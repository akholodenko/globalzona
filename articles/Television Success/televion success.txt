Television Success 
by 
Artem Kholodenko

	The world of television has become a competing and traumatic 
place.  It is not often that one sees a truely successful show such as 
"Seinfeld" or "Friends".  Failures have been witnessed all over the 
screen.  Starting with Pauli Shore's "Paulie" and all the way through 
Dan Akroyd's "Sould Man", the endless list is full of wanna-be-success 
stories.  But why is it so hard to appeal to the viewers?
	Unfortunately for producers, the answer is not that simple.  
The mystery lies in factors like the timeslot, character appeal, story 
line, and the time period the show is brought into the world.  For 
example, what appealed to people 2,3,5 years ago might not be 
interesting to watch now.  That's why the large amoung of family-
oriented shows like "Family Matters", "Full House", and "Step by Step" 
have gone out of style as sexualy-related programs like "Friends", 
"Seinfeld", and "Two Guys, A Girls, and a Pizza Place" took their 
place.
	People change their minds about their likes and dislikes 
extremely fast; so the network executves just have to keep up with 
those preferences.  World events cold easily effect the direction of 
the people, in turn the shows.  When the Clinton Scandal broke out all 
you would hear was a load of Clinton jokes covering the air waves.  
Being on top of the cultural topics may mean a climb to the top for a 
TV program.  Yet sometimes too much of a good thing may mean the end 
for a show with repetative humor.
	Sometimes the most radical idea might be the next big thing.  
A little thought about a show that is about nothing led to a soar of 
Jerry Seinfeld's carrier - you just never know!  The market is tough 
to penetrate and it is easier to try to bring in bad shows to viewers.  
However, networks should try to improve shows that were once great - 
just don't do it by bringingin new characters!
