                        <strong>Education-where/when/level</strong><br>
                        I'm a student at the Purdue Calumet University, which 
                        is located in suburbs of Chicago. Right now I'm a sophomore.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Present job</strong><br>
                        I work part time as an accountant, and I do modeling jobs 
                        around Chicago area on the side.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Goals for future</strong><br>
                        My dream is to finish school and major in International 
                        Relations. I want to travel, and visit every country in 
                        the world. I want to help minority groups all around the 
                        world, especially poor children in Eastern Europe, Africa, 
                        Asia, and Middle East. I also want to get married and 
                        have a nice family life, and be a mom one day, but I see 
                        that happening later on in my life. I would also like 
                        have a great modeling career ,and do runway shows, and 
                        print work for famous designers.last thing I want to do 
                        is visit all my relatives and friends back in Europe, 
                        which I have not seen in a few years because of a war.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What got you interested in modelling?</strong><br>
                        Many of my relatives and friends always told me to pursue 
                        a modeling career. They always used to tell me that I 
                        have the height and features. Most of all were the magazines. 
                        I always wanted to dress up and look glamorous and attract 
                        all the boys in my school.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How old were you?</strong><br>
                        I was only 13 years old<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What experience, if any, do you have modelling?</strong><br>
                        I went to the modeling school in my old city for a few 
                        months. From there I got accepted in an agency. I was 
                        only 14 at the time. Later on I went a few times to Milan 
                        to do fashion shows. I also did some some modeling jobs 
                        around the area. Recently I began to do medeling here 
                        in Chicago. I did a few photo shoots, and I'm starting 
                        to travel around USA for modeling assignments.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What kind of modelling do you see yourself doing?</strong><br>
                        I see myself doing fashion shows (creating different attitudes 
                        while on runway), photo shoots for female/male magazines 
                        and, lots of glamour modeling where I can dress up in 
                        nice fancy outfits.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Is there anything about the modelling profession 
                        that scares you?</strong><br>
                        Yes of course there is. I'm scared that I will meet a 
                        client that will want to go farther than just doing business 
                        with me. I'm also scared of having someone that you trust 
                        and give them your whole career in hands and they destroy 
                        it, or betray you. I'm also scared that if I make it as 
                        a model, one day I will be out of work because my look 
                        will be faded.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What is your strongest feature?</strong><br>
                        I would have to say 2 things my eyes and my long legs. 
                        I have big deep eyes and I can make many different expressions. 
                        Also my legs because I always get compliments on them.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How do you take care of your body? complexion?</strong><br>
                        I exercise very often. I take lots of aerobics classes 
                        in my gym. I love to relax in sauna, whirl pool, and steam 
                        room. I love to feed my skin with nice extra silky protein 
                        lotions. For my completion I do not do much. Once in a 
                        while I put a cucumber mask on. I use a day and night 
                        cream to make it nice and soft. I also always make sure 
                        that I do not wear make up very often, and if I do I make 
                        sure before I go to sleep I took it all off.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How do you feel in front of the camera?</strong><br>
                        I love camera. I used to be very shy, but now I love it. 
                        I can take pictures for hours. It just seems right for 
                        me to work with a photographer in fron of it. I absolutely 
                        love shoots. I can change my personality, and play with 
                        it.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What physical activities does your typical day 
                        consist of?</strong><br>
                        As I said I go ti gym every day and I take lots of classes. 
                        I also do cardio workouts. I try to park my car far away 
                        where ever I park it, so that I can just walk more. I 
                        clean my house all the time. On weekend I like to dance. 
                        Sometimes I go for roller blading.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Do you consider yourself a healthy eater?</strong><br>
                        Yes I do . I became vegetarian 2 years ago and since them 
                        I have been eating healthy vegetables, fruits, proteins(and 
                        a little bit of sweets on the side).<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What is your favorite food to binge on?</strong><br>
                        Chocolate. Wow I love it. Especially the European kind!<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What do you hope to achieve by modelling?</strong><br>
                        I hope to be a successfull model. It was my dream to walk 
                        on the catwalk with super models. Also just prove to myself 
                        that I can do it, and that my dreams payed off. I would 
                        also do positive things with all the money I would get. 
                        I would send some back to my poor relatives in Croatia, 
                        and Serbia, and donate some money to needy people and 
                        organizations.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Who is your role model (doesn't have to be a model)</strong><br>
                        I adore princess Diana. She was my favorite lady. She 
                        was pretty, charming, but at the same time she was a very 
                        successful business lady, and a woman that helped people 
                        around the world.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Which supermodel do you look up to the most?</strong><br>
                        I have a few but my favorite of all would have to be Naomi. 
                        She is just gorgeous. I love her long legs, and hair. 
                        She just presents the woman that I want to be like (vert 
                        glamorous).<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Would you ever pose in the nude?</strong><br>
                        I don't think that I would. I have a family that is very 
                        religious and I would never want to disappoint them, or 
                        embarrass my father.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What, if anything, could persuade you to pose 
                        nude?</strong><br>
                        As I said I would never do it, but maybe only for an exception 
                        I would if there was a good cause behind it. Like a few 
                        years ago when models posed nude for animal rights.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What would your family think of this choice?</strong><br>
                        They would not like it at all. They would be very mad 
                        at me for a long time. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What is the best beauty secret you know of that 
                        you utilize?</strong><br>
                        I like to put wet chamomile bags under my eyes and after 
                        a few minutes when I take them off my eyes look very fresh, 
                        and there is no circles or reddish areas around my eyes.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Are you willing to travel?</strong><br>
                        Yes it is a big part of modeling world and I would not 
                        mind it at all. If fact I love to travel, adn this would 
                        give me opportunity to see a lot of different parts of 
                        the world.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Are you willing to possibly relocate?</strong><br>
                        Yes I am. I do know that usually models need to move to 
                        a big city to pursue theit carrer. That is just a part 
                        of the business, and it makes you a good model if you 
                        do travel and relocate.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>If you had your choice of where to live, where 
                        would you choose?</strong><br>
                        It would be in Rio De Janeiro. Need to say more? It has 
                        great beaches, people are always happy and in a good mood, 
                        and it is the prettiest city that I ever saw.</font></div>
