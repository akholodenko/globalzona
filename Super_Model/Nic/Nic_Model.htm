                        <strong>Hometown</strong><br>
                        Originally from Berkshires, but I have lived in Europe, 
                        Sarasota FL, Miami FL, Vermont , and currently in NYC.

                        <strong>Education-where/when/level</strong><br>
                        High School was great!! I loved it and had a blast. I 
                        took AP (Advanced Placement). In high school, I was on 
                        the soccer team, track team, cross country team &amp; 
                        secretary of the wrestling team.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Present job</strong><br>
                        Full time, active NYC model. Actually I work in many places, 
                        and have done lots of work in Europe, as well as TV and 
                        movie work.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Goals for future</strong><br>
                        I have had many unique experiences and opportunities to 
                        see a lot of the world as a result of my modeling career. 
                        I feel a realistic goal of mine is to return to school 
                        in a few years and study psychology.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What got you interested in modelling?</strong><br>
                        When I was about 12 years old, my oldest sister's boyfrend 
                        was a photographer who kept telling me I should model. 
                        So finally one day we decided to give it a shot and we 
                        started doing fashion suppliments together. To be honest, 
                        I thought the idea of standing in front of a camera for 
                        a bunch of pictures was a waste of time because I was 
                        such a tomboy when I was growing up.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How old were you?</strong><br>
                        12 <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What experience, if any, do you have modelling?</strong><br>
                        When I was 16 yrs old, during the summer, I went to NY 
                        for Elite modeling agency, and started shooting with their 
                        photographers. Then I went to Europe and started doing 
                        fashion shows, commercials, editorial, calenders and covers. 
                        Now I've been in four calendars, continue doing lots of 
                        editorial work and fashion shows. Additionally, I've been 
                        in two films.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What kind of modeling do you see yourself doing?</strong><br>
                        I am actively doing: editorial work, fashion shows, calendars 
                        and covers. I've been told I am a very versatile model 
                        in front of the camera. Acting is also something that 
                        comes naturally to me. It's fun to be someone else once 
                        in a while.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Is there anything about the modelling profession 
                        that scares you?</strong><br>
                        I would say that it is disheartening when you hear stories 
                        about girls getting treated poorly. It is a business where 
                        you can set standards for yourself and still get work. 
                        I would encourage all aspiring models to set some standards 
                        for themselves, then you will strengthen your character 
                        when the time comes to put them into practice.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What is your strongest feature?</strong><br>
                        My strongest feature is who I am on the inside. You wouldn't 
                        know it to look at me because all models have to battle 
                        that preconcieved stereotype of being shallow. I'm a very 
                        deep, good, caring, and honest person. Others have said 
                        that my best feature is my face, lips, smile, long neck 
                        and hair. Makeup arttists always chime about my smooth 
                        flawless skin. But I'm happiest about my long legs, 47 
                        1/2 inches. In the Guiness book of world records, Naja 
                        Armen is a supermodel with the longest legs, 47 inches, 
                        so I have her beat by 1/2 an inch!<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How do you take care of your body? complexion?</strong><br>
                        I believe you need to take care of yourself inside and 
                        out, and maintain a healthy balance of everything. One 
                        little beauty secret my grandmother handed down to me, 
                        was to use witch hazel on my face. It works great, and 
                        gives me a clear complexion.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How do you feel in front of the camera?</strong><br>
                        Free. Like I can do anything or achieve anything. It is 
                        strange, because that is where people are happiest with 
                        me the most. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What physical activities does your typical day 
                        consist of?</strong><br>
                        Rushing, rushing, rushing, and more rushing around to 
                        jobs and castings all day long. That gives me a workout, 
                        but I do go to the gym to work all the muscle groups.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Do you consider yourself a healthy eater?</strong><br>
                        I eat mostly anything I want, and I eat only the best 
                        quality ice cream, but I try to make a point to eat healthy 
                        foods. Thank God for genetics!<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What is your favorite food to binge on?</strong><br>
                        Pickles and ice cream. My mom always says, &quot;when 
                        you get pregnant, you will finally eat normally.&quot;<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What do you hope to achieve by modeling?</strong><br>
                        I think the 'adventurer' in me gave me the spirit to model, 
                        and the 'achiever' in me keeps me going to do my best 
                        on each project. It really is a mini-career that needs 
                        to be a positive time in your life, because when you are 
                        young and constantly meeting new people, you are developing 
                        social skills that will dictate how successful you will 
                        be after your modeling career.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Who is your role model (doesn't have to be a model)</strong><br>
                        God, and people who are kind, deep, good, and honest.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Which supermodel do you look up to the most?</strong><br>
                        Unfortunately I've seen so many things and heard so many 
                        stories, that I choose to be my own person with my my 
                        own goals and morals and do not mimic my life after any 
                        supermodel.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Would you ever pose in the nude?</strong><br>
                        Maybe, if it was by a well known photographer who had 
                        a reputation for excellent artistic work.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What, if anything, could persuade you to pose 
                        nude?</strong><br>
                        The point above, about it being done by a great photographer. 
                        Also, the reason behind the shoot. Honestly, I don´t see 
                        the point in being completely nude. I think it is more 
                        sensual when you leave something for the imagination. 
                        On the other hand, Emma Sjoberg and several other supermodels 
                        have posed nude and have had great careers.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What would your family think of this choice?</strong><br>
                        They always support me.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What is the best beauty secret you know of that 
                        you utilize?</strong><br>
                        The vibrant happy energy that comes from within. A positive 
                        attitude is good for the mind, body, and soul.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Are you willing to travel?</strong><br>
                        Yes. Travelling is fun and always a great learning experience.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Are you willing to possibly relocate?</strong><br>
                        Yes.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>If you had your choice of where to live, where 
                        would you choose?</strong><br>
                        A deserted island with soft-white powdered sand, and blue-green 
                        glistening warm water. Not to mention orchards of sweet 
                        fruit at its peak of ripeness dangling from the trees. 
                        Twinkles from the stars and my arms wrapped around my 
                        soulmate. Ooops, got carried away :)</font></div>
