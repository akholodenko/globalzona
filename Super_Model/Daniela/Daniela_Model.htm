                        <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ACE4FF">I 
                        was born in Bucharest, Romania in 1979. I do not really 
                        remember very much about my country since I have lived 
                        in the USA for a while. I came here with my parents when 
                        I was 10 years old. I remember on the way here stopping 
                        in Italy for a week, and I had my first experience drinking 
                        Pepsi from a can. I had no idea how to open it, so my 
                        parents eventually used a can opener. My parents and I 
                        still laugh about it till this day. </font>
<p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ACE4FF">We 
                          first moved to New Hampshire, where we lived for two 
                          years. I went to school there, but for the first year 
                          I did not know a word of English. I took a test to see 
                          what I knew for my basic skills and I aced that test, 
                          so the school skipped me a year. I took that that year 
                          to learn English, instead of going to the next level. 
                          By the time next year came around, I mastered the language 
                          pretty well. After two years in NH, my parents decided 
                          to see what California is like. We thought it was the 
                          greatest thing that there is; a state where it is always 
                          hot. Well, we quickly found out that it is not always 
                          hot in the San Francisco area where we moved. My parents 
                          fell in love with the place anyway, so we stayed. I 
                          went to Junior High that sane year where I met my best 
                          friend Vanna. After that I went to high school at Castro 
                          Valley High School. I was pretty dorky, I think...I 
                          did not have that many close friends; two or three at 
                          the most, and that includes my Drafting teacher Mr. 
                          Burns. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ACE4FF">I 
                          was a little tomboyish, but I had my own style one would 
                          say. I met my first boyfriend, Josh, whom although I 
                          am no longer with, we are still great friends. Later 
                          on, I met my second boyfriend, Kevin, whom I am happily 
                          engaged to now. I got pretty good grades in high school, 
                          good enough to get into a university. I decided in my 
                          junior year in high school that I wanted to model. I 
                          had many people tell me that I am very pretty, but I 
                          did not think so; I was shy and I did not have very 
                          much confidence in myself. I went with my mom to John 
                          Casablancas, and I signed up for their classes. I learned 
                          some helpful things. They taught me some runway, some 
                          makeup tips, and some acting skills. Well, $1500 later, 
                          all I really got out of it was confidence. I am not 
                          saying that one should not take modeling classes, but 
                          I personally was not happy with what I got for the money. 
                          I was told by a JC representative that I was too short 
                          for modeling...this was after they took the money; before, 
                          when I first came, I was perfect for modeling. Well, 
                          I listened and did not pursue it any longer. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ACE4FF">I 
                          went to school and focused on that, I got great grades, 
                          and was on my way to go to college when I realized that 
                          my parents were not be able to help me with anything 
                          for college. Both of my parents were working two full 
                          time jobs, but with so many bills, one being John Casablancas, 
                          it was hard. That is when I got a job at a mall for 
                          Guess, and although I tried my hardest, I was let go 
                          after the holiday season was over. I was so sad, and 
                          I was not sure what to do. That is when I decided that 
                          I was going to work for them again, only this time as 
                          a model. I went to a Junior College in the Bay Area, 
                          where I took classes to become a teacher. I want to 
                          work with young kids, elementary level. I really want 
                          to be the one that starts them off right; I want to 
                          make a difference in their lives. In the mean time, 
                          while attending school, I went to a casting call for 
                          a place called Style in the South San Francisco area. 
                          From them, I met my agency, Affinity, whom I have been 
                          with ever since. I have done many fashion shows, hair 
                          shows, promotions, and even two films as an extra. Last 
                          year, I decided that I want to learn HTML and do my 
                          own website. I bought a book, and started to teach myself. 
                          I eventually took a class on the subject, and I learned 
                          more techniques. I built my site, which will never be 
                          finished. I always learn new things about HTML, and 
                          I am always eager to try them out on my site. </font></p>
                        <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ACE4FF">In 
                          February 2000, I moved to the Los Angeles area with 
                          Kevin, my fiancée. I left my parents and Vanna back 
                          in the SF area. I miss them all everyday, but I still 
                          get to see them pretty often when they visit. My agency 
                          has also been keeping me pretty busy with some jobs 
                          here, and I travel back and forth from LA to SF often. 
                          My goals for the future are that I finish my education 
                          and become an Elementary School teacher. I have one 
                          more year at a Junior College, and then I will transfer 
                          to UC Los Angeles or UC Santa Barbara, have not decided 
                          yet. I love modeling and I will continue modeling for 
                          a long time hopefully. I have two reasons that I am 
                          modeling: one is to save up money for college, so that 
                          is what I am focusing on right now. My other reason 
                          is to save up money to buy my mother a home to retire 
                          in. She has been continually working at least one full 
                          time job, most of the time two full time jobs, and I 
                          really would love to see her happy, relaxed, and not 
                          worried about bills. She deserves this more than anyone 
                          out there; I love her so much. One of my modeling dreams 
                          is to do a print job for Guess or Bebe. I love both 
                          of their designs; every time I wear them I get comments 
                          that I should model for them...most of the time from 
                          people that I never met before. Ideally, I will get 
                          the opportunity to joggle between teaching and modeling.</font></p>
