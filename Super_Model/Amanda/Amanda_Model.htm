                        Charlottesville, Virginia<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Education-where/when/level:</strong> <br>
                        I attended both private and public schools. We moved quite 
                        a bit so I went to a few different schools, which was 
                        really good for me: accommodating to new surroundings, 
                        people, etc. In the middle of high school, I decided to 
                        home school so that I could model and travel. The programs 
                        were excellent and I taught myself. I graduated early 
                        with honors. I was always an A student.<br>
                        <br>
                        I am a very strong believer in education. It is crucial 
                        to a well rounded individual. I went to an Interior Design 
                        school and apprenticed, so I could have a craft to fall 
                        back on while I modeled in NYC, etc. I couldn't fully 
                        commit to a college program at the time because of my 
                        career. I am still in the same boat now. Unfortunately, 
                        in my business, you have a limited window of opportunity 
                        and so I need to seize this while I can. School, right 
                        now would compete with my career. I questioned my decision 
                        for a while, being from a highly educated background, 
                        where Ivy Leagues were the norm. I thought I'd be apt 
                        to follow the same path. But I am glad I held off on it. 
                        I feel like I made a wise decision. I will work for now 
                        and in the future definitely go back. I would like to 
                        study Psychology.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Present job:</strong><br>
                        Model and Actress<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Goals for future:</strong><br>
                        My future goals are, to number one, be HAPPY!!!!! As well 
                        as have peace, love, and personal satisfaction in whatever 
                        path or career I may chose. I would like to continue to 
                        model as much as possible. I want to keep acting as well 
                        and take it to the next level. I continue to study hard 
                        to perfect my craft.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What got you interested in modeling?</strong><br>
                        When I was about 16, an agent saw me at a mall, and recommended 
                        I give it a try and come to NYC for a test...I was hesitant 
                        but went for it. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How old were you?</strong><br>
                        16 <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What experience, if any, do you have modeling?</strong><br>
                        Quite a bit actually.....Print campaigns for Skincare, 
                        makeup, and clothes. As well as commercial print, editorial, 
                        fashion, catalogue, lingerie, and swimwear. I have done 
                        a few calendars too. I have also done some runway, showroom, 
                        and spokes modeling.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What kind of modeling do you see yourself doing?</strong><br>
                        Print jobs for products such as lingerie, beauty, etc. 
                        I also want to produce my own calendar very soon, when 
                        I feel the time is right.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Is there anything about the modeling profession 
                        that scares you?</strong><br>
                        Just its effect on young girls and women in the world. 
                        It really can distort their views of beauty and body image. 
                        Many of the ideals in it are unnatural for the human form, 
                        and warped at times. Especially in the hi-fashion world, 
                        where bone thin is always in.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What is your strongest feature?</strong><br>
                        Probably my eyes and my legs.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How do you take care of your body? complexion?</strong><br>
                        Body: By working out alot..(or when I can, lol) I run, 
                        swim, lift weights, hike, stretch, meditate, and try to 
                        get an adequate amount of sleep...the more the merrier!!! 
                        I also try to watch what I eat to some level. I eat healthy 
                        stuff for the most part. I do let myself go at least one 
                        or two days a week and eat whatever I want...pig out more 
                        or less.<br>
                        <br>
                        Complexion: I use soap and water and an SPF 15 or higher 
                        on my face, to prevent damage.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How do you feel in front of the camera?</strong><br>
                        It depends on my mood.....just kidding!!! I am very comfortable 
                        in front of the camera. Probably more so than I am comfortable 
                        in a group of people. I was always a shy girl, for the 
                        most part, but the camera helped me break down that shyness. 
                        I have never been shy in front of the camera.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What physical activities does your typical day 
                        consist of?</strong><br>
                        Physical activities? Well, all you do from day to day 
                        in Los Angeles is run, run, run. Or drive, drive, drive 
                        for that matter . I go to meetings with photographers, 
                        auditions, castings, photoshoots, etc. I also work out 
                        every day or so. And of course I sleep and shower, you 
                        know? ..the usual stuff ! <br>
                        lol : )<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Do you consider yourself a healthy eater?</strong><br>
                        Yes for the most part , but I have my days!!!<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What is your favorite food to binge on?</strong><br>
                        Pizza and jellybeans for sure.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What do you hope to achieve by modeling?</strong><br>
                        I hope to achieve financial stability and freedom. I would 
                        also love to achieve more recognition, and to travel more 
                        and see all kinds of things and people, like it has somewhat 
                        allowed me do already. I would also like for it to help 
                        me launch my acting career.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Who is your role model (doesn't have to be a model)</strong><br>
                        My mother. She is a wonderful, beautiful, spiritual person, 
                        and my best friend!!!<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Which supermodel do you look up to the most?</strong><br>
                        I'd have to say Laetitia Casta because she has defied 
                        the laws of modeling, proving you can be a wonderful model 
                        at a shorter height and larger size.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Would you ever pose in the nude?</strong><br>
                        Possibly. It all depends on the job. There is art and 
                        there is pornography. This is a case by case issue. However, 
                        right now, I would be inclined to say no. It is better 
                        sometimes when there is something left to the imagination.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What, if anything, could persuade you to pose 
                        nude?</strong><br>
                        A few million dollars no doubt....ha ha ha...Once again, 
                        this is a case by case issue.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What would your family think of this choice?</strong><br>
                        They all have different opinions, but are usually supportive 
                        of my decisions.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What is the best beauty secret you know of that 
                        you utilize?</strong><br>
                        My mom taught me as a little girl to put Vaseline on my 
                        eyelashes every night. I do it to this day, and they stay 
                        long and lush...so something works !!! <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Are you willing to travel?</strong><br>
                        Of course!!! <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Are you willing to possibly relocate?</strong><br>
                        Yes. It depends on such things as to where, circumstances, 
                        type of modeling, etc.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>If you had your choice of where to live, where 
                        would you choose?</strong><br>
                        I would have a place in beautiful Virginia, near the Blue 
                        Ridge Mountains, and a place in Malibu on the beach....that's 
                        not asking too much now is it?? <br>
                        lol : )</font></font></div>
