                        <strong>Education-where/when/level</strong><br>
                        I graduated in 1996 from Orange County High School.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Present job</strong><br>
                        I work for an animal hospital as a veterinarian technician.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Goals for future</strong><br>
                        I simply hope to succeed in all that I put my mind to. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What got you interested in modelling?</strong><br>
                        I was not the typical little girl that dreamed of becoming 
                        a model when I grew up. In fact I was much the tom-boy 
                        and cared nothing for beauty. Modeling was something that 
                        found me and I then pursued it.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How old were you?</strong><br>
                        I was 15 when I was first approached by a modeling scout.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What experience, if any, do you have modelling?</strong><br>
                        I cannot say I know everything about the modeling business 
                        - in fact I still have much to learn. I only model on 
                        a part time basis and have gained my knowledge through 
                        those that I was fortunate enough to work with and learn 
                        from.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What kind of modelling do you see yourself doing?</strong><br>
                        With all the different types of modeling I have experienced, 
                        I enjoy runway the most. I like being on stage and love 
                        to meet and work with many people.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Is there anything about the modelling profession 
                        that scares you?</strong><br>
                        Absolutely! If I were to say no I would be lying to myself. 
                        When I take a job I always like to obtain references and 
                        then thoroughly check them. As a freelance model, one 
                        can never tell how trustworthy or honest the person she's 
                        about to work for truly is.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What is your strongest feature?</strong><br>
                        In front of a camera I have been told that my strongest 
                        feature is my eyes. This of course was not a gift handed 
                        to me but something that I had to learn to use when I 
                        was in front of the camera. That is to say, I have to 
                        make a conscious effort to make my eyes appear "just right," 
                        but when I'm successful, the results are usually great.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How do you take care of your body? complexion?</strong><br>
                        First, my job keeps me very active - trying to hold down 
                        a 150 lb. rotweiller can be a chore! So my active job 
                        helps, but I have also been faithfully working out at 
                        the gym for about 5 years. When I don't go to the gym, 
                        I work out and run at my home. As for my complexion, I 
                        simply use facial scrubs and lots of moisturizer.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>How do you feel in front of the camera?</strong><br>
                        At first I was very nervous. Although I've been in front 
                        of a camera many times, each time is different for me 
                        and for the first 30 minutes I am pretty nervous. After 
                        I get past that, I start to loosen up and begin to enjoy 
                        it.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What physical activities does your typical day 
                        consist of?</strong><br>
                        I do a lot of lifting, squatting, walking, and animal 
                        restraint at work. Working at a vet hospital really helps 
                        me to maintain a good physical appearance.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Do you consider yourself a healthy eater?</strong><br>
                        Yes, for the most part I am, but like any other normal 
                        female I get cravings. When I shop I try to get plenty 
                        of fresh vegetables and fruits and stay away from the 
                        fried foods.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What is your favorite food to binge on?</strong><br>
                        I don't really have a favorite. When I do get a craving, 
                        it varies from one food to another.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What do you hope to achieve by modelling?</strong><br>
                        Since I model only on a part-time basis, I haven't established 
                        unrealistic goals. I would of course love to become a 
                        supermodel, but realizing the unlikely chances of that 
                        happening I prefer to stay concentrated on the many other 
                        life opportunities.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Who is your role model (doesn't have to be a model)</strong><br>
                        This might sound odd but I have to say my fiance. I doubt 
                        that you really want to hear all the reasons why so I 
                        will save everyone the time, and just say that I admire 
                        and look up to him.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Which supermodel do you look up to the most?</strong><br>
                        No one in particular. I feel as though they all have their 
                        own special features and talents in the business. I admire 
                        them all for their hard work and determination. This business 
                        can be cruel and very difficult - anyone who succeeds 
                        has my utmost respect.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Would you ever pose in the nude?</strong><br>
                        Possibly but only if I felt it would benefit me in some 
                        way, so suffice it to say...probably not.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What, if anything, could persuade you to pose 
                        nude?</strong><br>
                        If after thoroughly considering the consequences, I decided 
                        that the job might enhance my modeling career rather than 
                        tarnish it, I would model nude. The opportunities for 
                        this kind of modeling are so very few, however, that I 
                        doubt I'll ever be "persuaded."<br>

                        <strong>What would your family think of this choice?</strong><br>
                        I am the strong one in the family. I have always been 
                        told from my family that I had a good head on my shoulders. 
                        So, I feel that they would be supportive of my choices, 
                        as would my fiance.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What is the best beauty secret you know of that 
                        you utilize?</strong><br>
                        Before bed I wash my face with warm water and moisturize 
                        around my eyes. When I get up my skin feels like silk 
                        and no bags around the eyes.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Are you willing to travel?</strong><br>
                        Yes, I have already had to travel for jobs. I think travelling 
                        is my favorite part of the industry.<br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>Are you willing to possibly relocate?</strong><br>
                        This again would have to be something that would significantly 
                        benefit me. <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>If you had your choice of where to live, where 
                        would you choose?</strong><br>
                        I would love to go back to TX. I love the land, people, 
                        and culture, but most of all the warm weather.</font></div>
