			  	It has been a long time since the old design was create and the site definately needed a face lift.  
				Here is the first version of the new site.  As time passes more revisions will be made.  
				However this is just the beginning.<br><br>
				Some previous sections and categories will not be making it to the new version of the site.  
				But not to worry, the most visited sections, such as notes for school will be up fully.<br><br>
				We are always happy to hear feedback from visitors.  So please let us know what you like, don't 
				like, and would like added.  We will review all comments with pleasure.<br><br>
