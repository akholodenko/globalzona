<font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Arnold strikes back at the devil in the mystifying and 
                          action-packed End of Days. This film follows the grand 
                          list of previous stigmata-like motion pictures. Although 
                          the extensive promotions and big-time look of the film, 
                          the audience is left with a two-faced feeling at the 
                          conclusion of the "goofy" plotted movie. <br>
                          The basic story is of an ex-xop (Arnold) working at 
                          a security - bodyguard firm and one day being called 
                          to a job to protect a supposed Wall Street broker who 
                          has actually been posesed by the devil. Eventually Arnold 
                          ends up protecting his female co-star from the devil's 
                          johnson. The reason for that is because she had been 
                          chosen at birth to bare the devil's child. There is 
                          however one little problem, she has to impregnanted 
                          between 11:00 pm and mid-night of December 31, 1999.

                          If you enjoy the soul being scarred out of you every 
                          five minute, then End of Days is the thing for you! 
                          At every turn there is something jumping out and poping 
                          in. You will be glued to the seat, which might be a 
                          bit wet if you have a weak bladder. <br>
                          The film's special effects that were supposedly proving 
                          the might power of the devil were nothing out of the 
                          ordinary and loop holes filled the scenes. For example, 
                          the devil took a human's body that could not be hurt 
                          by bullets. Yet the bullets were able to slow him down. 
                          He's the devil, why would bullets that can't hurt him 
                          slow him like the T1000 in Terminator 2. <br>
                          Elbert did give this film an unfortunate thumb down. 
                          Yet I leave it up to the audience because being a Schwarzenegger 
                          fan myself, I overall enjoyed the film. One last thing 
                          - Arnold, shave!</font>
