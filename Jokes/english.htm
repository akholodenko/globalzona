                              Security. After waiting in line for quite a long 
                              time he arrived at the counter. The woman behind 
                              the counter asked him for his identification to 
                              verify his age. He looked in his pockets and realized 
                              he had left his wallet at home. He told the woman 
                              that he seemed to have left his wallet at home. 
                              "Will I have to go home and come back now?" he asks. 
                              The woman says, "Unbutton your shirt." He opens 
                              his shirt revealing lots of curly silver hair. She 
                              says, "That silver hair on your chest is proof enough 
                              for me," as she processes his Social Security application. 
                              When he gets home, the man excitedly tells his wife 
                              about his experience at the Social Security office. 
                              She says, "You should have dropped your pants --

                              wanted to buy the most exotic pet they had. The 
                              owner showed him Parrots, Fish, etc, and the guy 
                              said, 'No, I meant Exotic Exotic' 'OK' said the 
                              saleman, follow me... So, they went into this back 
                              room and there on the floor was the ugliest toad 
                              he had ever seen... 'What is this' he asked. 'It 
                              is the most exotic toad you will find' replied the 
                              saleman. 'I'll leave the room for a minute and when 
                              I come back, you tell me what you decide.' So, the 
                              saleman leaves, and the toad proceeds to stick out 
                              his tongue and give this guy the best blow-job he 
                              has ever had. The saleman returns and the customer 
                              says, 'I'll take it..no matter what the cost.' After 
                              he gets the toad home, he sits him on the kitchen 
                              table and starts digging through cook books and 
                              pots and pans.... His wife comes in and says, 'What

                                day. She told the class that there would be no

                                replies. "Well where is the dog?" asks the cashier. 
                                "My dog is at home" replies the man. "To be able 
                                to sell you the dog food sir, I must see the dog. 
                                That is store policy", says the cashier. So with 
                                that the man leaves the dog food and leaves the 
                                store. Next day the man goes back to the same 
                                store, grabs what he needs and goes to the same 
                                cashier. He places two cans of cat food on the 
                                counter. "Do you own a cat sir?" asks the cashier. 
                                "Yes I do", replies the man. "Well where is your 
                                cat sir?" asks the cashier. "My cat is at home" 
                                says the man. "Well I am sorry sir. Store policy. 
                                I must see the cat before I can sell you cat food" 
                                says the cashier. So with that the man leaves 
                                the store empty handed again. The next day the 
                                man returns to the store and walks directly to 
                                the same cashier. He has a brown paper bag in 
                                his hand. "Here," he says to the cashier, "put 
                                your hand in here." So the cashier puts her hand 
                                in the brown paper bag. "It is all soft and warm" 
                                she says. "Yes, that is right" says the man, "I 
                                need to buy two rolls of toilet paper." </font></div>

                                from her, or who were horrible in bed. So she 
                                put an Ad in the paper, that was asking for a 
                                man who: 1)would treat her nicely 2)wouldn't run 
                                away from her, 3)would be good in bed. Three weeks 
                                passed, and there was no reply from any man. So 
                                she just figured that there wasn't a man alive 
                                who could live up to these expectations, so she 
                                just gave up. But then, one day she heard the 
                                doorbell rang. She answered it, and there on the

                                have any arms or legs. The man said 'I'm here 
                                about the ad you put in the paper. As you can 
                                see, I have no arms so I can't beat you, and I 
                                have no legs so I can't run away from you.' The 
                                woman replied, 'Yes, but are you good in bed?' 
                                And the man said with a smirk on his face, 'How

                              The pharmacist says the condoms come inpacks of 
                              3, 9 or 12 and asks which the young man wants. 'Well,' 
                              he said, 'I've been seeing this girl for a while 
                              and she's really hot. I want the condoms because 
                              I think tonight's 'the' night. We're having dinner

                              I've got a feeling I'm gonna get lucky after that. 
                              Once she's had me, she'll want me all the time, 
                              so you'd better give me the 12 pack.' The young 
                              man makes his purchase and leaves. Later that evening, 
                              he sits down to dinner with his girlfriend and her

                              praying with his head down for several minutes after 
                              everyone starts eating. The girl leans over and 
                              says, 'You never told me that you were such a religious 
                              person.' He leans over to her and says, 'You never

                              Everybody who has a dog calls him "Rover" or "Boy." 
                              I call mine Sex. Now Sex has been very embarrassing 
                              to me. When I went to City Hall to renew his dog 
                              license, I told the clerk I would like to have a 
                              license for Sex. He said, "I'd like to have one, 
                              too." Then I said, "But this is a dog!" He said 
                              he didn't care what she looked like. Then I said, 
                              "But you don't understand. I've had Sex since I 
                              was nine years old." He said I must have been quite 
                              a kid. When I got married and went on my honeymoon, 
                              I took the dog with me. I told the motel clerk that 
                              I wanted a room for my wife and me and a special 
                              room for Sex. He said every room in the place was 
                              for sex. I said, "You don't understand. Sex keeps 
                              me awake at night!" The clerk said, "Me too." One 
                              day I entered Sex in a contest, but before the competition 
                              began, the dog ran away. Another contestant asked 
                              me why I was just standing there looking around. 
                              I told him I had planned to have Sex in the contest. 
                              He told me I should have sold my own tickets. "But 
                              you don't understand," I said, "I had hoped to have 
                              Sex on TV." He called me a show-off. When my wife 
                              and I separated, we went to court to fight custody 
                              of the dog. I said, "Your honor, I had Sex before 
                              I was married." The judge said, "Me too." Then I 
                              told him that after I was married, Sex left me. 
                              He said, "Me too." Last night Sex ran off again. 
                              I spent hours looking around town for him. A cop 
                              came over to me and asked, "What are you doing in 
                              this alley at 4:00 in the morning?" I said, "I'm 
                              looking for Sex." My case comes up Friday <b><u><br>

                              Dad says, "Well son, let me try to explain it this 
                              way: I'm the breadwinner of the family, so let's 
                              call me Capitalism. Your Mom, she's the administrator 
                              of the money, so we'll call her the Government. 
                              We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll 
                              call you the People. The nanny, we'll consider her 
                              the Working Class. Now your baby brother, we'll 
                              call him the Future. ow, think about that and see 
                              if that makes sense." So the little boy goes off 
                              to bed thinking about what Dad has said. Later that 
                              night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets 
                              up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely 
                              soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his 
                              parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. 
                              Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's 
                              room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole 
                              and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives 
                              up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little 
                              boy says to his father, "Dad, I think I understand 
                              the concept of politics now." The father says, "Good 
                              son, tell me in your own words what you think politics 
                              is all about." The little boy replies, "Well, while 
                              Capitalism is screwing the Working Class, the Government 
                              is sound asleep, the People are being ignored and

                              man and a woman have been married for many years 
                              and it was about Christmas time. The wife LOVED 
                              pets, so the man went to a pet store and asked the 
                              manager: "My wife loves pets, so do you have anything 
                              special for her for Christmas that I can get?" The 
                              manager said: "Actually, I do. His name is Chet 
                              and he is a singing parrot. He sings Christmas Carols!" 
                              The man said: "Sure...Show me!" The manager took 
                              a lighter and placed it underneath the right foot 
                              of the parrot. The parrot began to sing Jingle Bells. 
                              Then he moved the lighter to the left foot and the 
                              parrot sang Holy Night. Now the man was enjoying 
                              this tramendously and decided to get the parrot. 
                              When he got home he said to his wife: "I got you 
                              the perfect gift...so open it now!" She opened the 
                              big present and inside the cage was a parrot. The 
                              man said it was a talking parrot, but the wife didn't 
                              believe him so he showed her. 1st the lighter under 
                              the right foot then the left. The wife said: "Wow! 
                              I wonder what would happen if you put it BETWEEN 
                              his feet?!" So the man did just that and the parrot 
                              began to sing: "Chet's nuts roasting on an open
