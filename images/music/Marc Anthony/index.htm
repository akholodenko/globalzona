                  Anthony is the first record in English by a singer who has twice 
                  sold out Madison Square Garden, starred in a Broadway musical 
                  (Paul Simon's "The Capeman"), appeared in significant roles 
                  in several movies, including Martin Scorsese's "Bringing Out 
                  the Dead," and sold more records throughout the world than any 
                  other salsa singer. In places where Spanish is spoken, and especially 
                  in Puerto Rico, Anthony is held in a regard that approaches 
                  reverence. A man in Spanish Harlem, quoted in a profile of Anthony 
                  in The New Yorker, said of him, "He is like a flame that walks." 
                  <br>
                  <img src="m_a_performance.jpg" width="125" height="180" align="left">"When 
                  I Dream at Night," the first song on Marc Anthony, was written 
                  by Dan Shea and Robin Thicke. Its chorus begins "'Cause I only 
                  feel alive/ When I dream at night/ Even though she's not real 
                  it's all right." <br>
                  "It's sort of a custom-made love song," Anthony says. "The three 
                  of us were talking about subjects for songs, and I told them 
                  a story I was going through. 'There's a situation,' I said, 
                  'There's this girl in my dreams that I see all the time.'" <br>
                  Anthony feels disinclined to choose his favorite among the songs 
                  on the record—"They're all like my kids," he says--but he is 
                  especially fond of two of them, "Am I the Only One," and "My 
                  Baby You." <br>
                  "As far as painting a picture," he says, "the first song lyrically 
                  that I'm proudest of is 'Am I the Only One.' I tried to capture 
                  loneliness between this couple that have gone wrong and aren't 
                  exactly sure why. <br>
                  "'My Baby You' is written for my daughter, Arianna, who is six. 
                  I wrote it so that she could understand it. It's a daddy professing 
                  his love." <br>
                  Anthony is thirty-one. Born in New York's Spanish Harlem, he 
                  was given the name Marco Antonio Muniz by his father, Felipe, 
                  a musician, for a famous Mexican singer and became Marc Anthony 
                  to avoid becoming confused with the older man. As recently as 
                  six years ago, Anthony was singing in English in dance clubs 
                  in New York City. A respectable audience was a hundred people. 
                  He specialized in a tersely minimal form of dance music called 
                  house music, in which a singer repeats a phrase over and over, 
                  with slight variations, to the accompaniment of a rhythm track 
                  recorded on a DAT. He also frequently sang background on records 
                  with a band called the Latin Rascals, who worked with a producer 
                  called Little Louis Vega. When Vega received a contract from 
                  Atlantic Records, in 1991, he asked Anthony to be his singer. 
                  None of their records was especially successful, but one of 
                  them, "Rebel," was a hit in the clubs. It occasionally still 
                  turns up in second-hand record stores in Manhattan. <br>
                  In 1992, the Latin percussionist and bandleader Tito Puente 
                  asked Vega and Anthony to open his revue at Madison Square Garden. 
                  After singing before such an enormous crowd, Anthony lost his 
                  appetite for appearing in clubs. His manager suggested that 
                  he sing in Spanish but he wasn't interested. When he was a small 
                  boy, his father would invite musicians to the family's apartment 
                  on Saturday nights and they would set up in the kitchen and 
                  play half the night. Anthony's father would put him on the table 
                  to sing. "I had two sets," Anthony says. "Six and eight." His 
                  repertoire consisted of a single song, "El Zolsar," about a 
                  kind of bird that lives in Puerto Rico. "He had only that one 
                  song," his father says, "but he could belt it." Growing up, 
                  Anthony listened mostly to rhythm & blues and to rock. Several 
                  months into his hiatus, he was driving in a car in Manhattan 
                  and he heard a song on the radio by a singer named Juan Gabriel. 
                  "It was called 'Hasta Que Te Conoci,'" Anthony says, "which 
                  means, 'Until I Met You,' and it ripped me apart. I don't know 
                  why and I don't want to know why. I called my manager and asked 
                  if I could record this in salsa." <img src="clinton_m_a.jpg" width="125" height="88" align="right"><br>
                  Acclaim arrived so suddenly in Anthony's life that he describes 
                  its appearance by saying, "I saw my old life shattered." In 
                  1993, he recorded the song he'd heard in the car. His manager 
                  then sent him to perform at a Latin music convention called 
                  Radio y Musica. Anthony brought with him a DAT that contained 
                  the song's musical tracks. He was living at the time on so little 
                  money that the clothes he performed in were borrowed. In the 
                  audience were mainly disc jockeys. When he took the stage one 
                  person clapped. His hand on the microphone trembled. He closed 
                  his eyes and thought, 'Make believe you're singing in your living 
                  room to your mom,' and when he finished he left the stage so 
                  quickly that his manager had to grab him and point out that 
                  he was receiving a standing ovation. Several of the disc jockeys 
                  were dialing their cell phones. "Find this kid's CD," he heard 
                  one of them say. "I threw it out this morning--it's in the trash. 
                  Find it and play it!" <br>
                  Later that day, he appeared on a television show called "Carnival 
                  Internacional," which is broadcast all over the world. "That 
                  changed my life forever," he says. "I mean in one day. It seemed 
                  like years before I was ever in New York again. I was booked 
                  and booked and booked--Panama, Ecuador, Argentina, Colombia, 
                  Puerto Rico, Miami, Los Angeles. I woke up once in the middle 
                  of the night in a hotel and didn't know where I was. I called 
                  my brother's room and said, 'Where are we?' He said, 'Look out 
                  the window.' All I could see was a city at night. Tokyo. I thought, 
                  'How did this happen?'" <br>
                  Anthony was the first actor Paul Simon cast in "The Capeman." 
                  Simon had gone to a record store and asked for the records of 
                  the best young salsa singer. "They gave me two or three guys," 
                  he says, "and I listened to his and thought, This is good. In 
                  fact, really good. In fact, he was clearly the best." During 
                  the musical's rehearsals, Anthony was releasing his third salsa 
                  album, Contra la Corriente (Against the Current) which was certified 
                  RIAA gold out of the box. Because of his obligation to the musical 
                  he wasn't able to promote the record, so as a farewell of a 
                  kind, he gave a concert at Madison Square Garden. No salsa singer 
                  had ever gone into the Garden except as a member of a revue. 
                  Anthony sold every seat in the house, and a year later did it 
                  again. <br>
                  Having sung exclusively in Spanish, except in "The Capeman," 
                  Anthony has managed to remain relatively undiscovered in America. 
                  With the release of Marc Anthony he is likely, once again, to 
                  see his old life shattered. <br>
