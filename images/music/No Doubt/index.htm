                    </b>Anaheim, California. Little Eric Stefani writes his first 
                    song, &quot;Stick It In The Hole,&quot; about a pencil sharpener, 
                    forcing sister Gwen to sing along. Gwen was more interested

                    years later, when he was 18, his parents bought him a kit 
                    for Christmas and he learned &quot;Wild Flower&quot; by the

                    mean: Rock 'n' Roll; a wee lad with a prized KISS record living 
                    in Irvine (California), he dreamed of being a rock star. When

                    December 1986<br>
                    </b>Back-flipping singer John Spence forms the Orange County-based 
                    2 Tone ska group No Doubt -- named after his favorite expression 
                    -- with keyboardist Eric, who forces Gwen to sing backing 
                    vocals. Gwen cites Madness, Kermit the Frog, Julie Andrews 
                    and Fishbone's Angelo Moore as her heroes.<br>

                    their first &quot;official&quot; gig at Fender's Ballroom 
                    in Long Beach, California; the band was second on a bill of 
                    fourteen with The Untouchables headlining. Tony was one of 
                    several hundred people watching.<br>
                    <br>
                    Shortly after, Tony, a high-school junior, shows up to try 
                    out wearing baggy pants and Mexican sandals. Band accepts 
                    him even though this is his first band; still a high-school 
                    senior, Gwen eagerly accepts him.<br>

                    <b>Summer 1987<br>
                    </b>Gwen kisses Tony at an Orange County party. They hide 
                    their relationship from the band. An organized perfectionist, 
                    Tony becomes the band manager (now he's just the bass player).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Dec. 21, 1987<br>
                    </b>Tragically, John Spence shoots himself at an Anaheim park. 
                    A few days later, No Doubt plays big industry gig at the Roxy 
                    in Hollywood; but devastated over John's suicide, they call 
                    it quits. Days later, they reform knowing that's what John 
                    would want.<br>

                    Spring 1988<br>
                    </b>Heavy-metal guitarist Tom, a college music student, leaves 
                    his sister's heavy-metal band, Rising, because the metal scene 
                    in O.C. sucks; after peering in the window while No Doubt 
                    rehearsed, Tom pulls his long hair into a ponytail and joins 
                    the ska-heavy No Doubt, adding a heavier edge.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>1987-1988<br>
                    </b>Part of the then-underground-ska-scene, No Doubt built 
                    a huge following of loyal &quot;rude boys&quot; and &quot;rude 
                    girls&quot; after numerous gigs opening for The Untouchables 
                    and Fishbone, as well as their own all-ages shows. Through 
                    this following, they were able to avoid the &quot;pay-to-play&quot; 
                    crap many young bands acquiesced to. A three-song and a five-song 
                    demo are sold at shows.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Summer 1989<br>
                    </b>Drummer, huge No Doubt fan and fibber, Adrian joins No 
                    Doubt after calling a number from the back of a demo tape; 
                    he tells No Doubt he has years of experience, but later admits 
                    he only has one. His love of 70's rock and ska made the choice 
                    obvious. No Doubt plays their first out-of-state show in Arizona 
                    in front of about a hundred people.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>1989-1990<br>
                    </b>No Doubt evolved into a solid five-piece unit, expanding 
                    their sound to include the styles of each member. The natural 
                    evolution caused a few &quot;rude kids&quot; to fall away, 
                    but with shows opening for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ziggy 
                    Marley and Mano Negra, their fan base broadened to the college 
                    crowd. Pizza mailing list parties became the modus operandi 
                    as the list, which was started in 1987, grows from a few hundred 
                    names to a couple thousand. (In 1993, when the list reaches 
                    approximately 7,000 names, Tony decides to have just pizza 
                    parties).<br>

                    </b>No Doubt signs a &quot;big&quot; recording contract with 
                    Interscope Records; they continue driving around O.C. in their 
                    old cars and work day jobs (Gwen and Tony were sales people 
                    at the same department store, Adrian waited tables at a steak 
                    house, and Tom ran a small music equipment rental business). 
                    Interscope head honcho Jimmy Lovine predicts Gwen will be 
                    a star in five years. The band really wants to be played on 
                    local radio station KROQ.<br>

                    Gwen's an art major, Tony and Adrian are psychology majors 
                    -- it's a smart band), band drives to a Los Angeles studio 
                    as often as possible to record their debut album, a 14-song 
                    collection of older material (1987) as well as recently penned 
                    tracks; on a budget, they spend less than $13,000.<br>

                    <b>March 1992<br>
                    </b>Self-titled No Doubt released. Only 30,000 sold; grunge 
                    is in; they don't get played on KROQ. Adrian remembers the 
                    program director saying, &quot;It would take an act of God 
                    for this band to get on the radio.&quot; Enough said.<br>
                    <br>
                    In support of No Doubt, the band embarks on their first two-week 
                    13-show Western-state headlining tour in two vans (five members, 
                    a three-piece horn section, a roadie, tour manager/soundman 
                    and equipment).<br>

                    a mere $5,000; MTV never played it, but M2 does now. No Doubt 
                    once again make a two-week Western run.<br>

                    month national-tour -- still in a van. Although, predominately 
                    headlining small clubs, the band plays a couple shows with

                    </b>No Doubt begins the first sessions for what would be called 
                    Tragic Kingdom. The album was recorded in eleven different 
                    studios over two and a half years. Tony refers to it as a 
                    &quot;battleground&quot; -- and there were casualties.<br>

                    the 10-song Beacon Street Collection, named after the house 
                    on Beacon Street in Anaheim where several<br>
                    members lived and the garage studio where most of the tracks 
                    were recorded. They sold out of the first thousand CD's within 
                    two weeks after selling them at shows and local record stores

                    went through some really bad times in the past couple years

                    </b>No Doubt takes some much needed time off, adjusts to being 
                    home, step across the Orange County border, and settle into 
                    new addresses within the L.A. County line; two now reside 
                    in Long Beach and two in Los Feliz. They stop eating at fast 
                    food eateries&#151;except Tony. Renting out a Hollywood Hills 
                    home, the band begins writing songs for their forthcoming 
                    CD&#151;finding their direction; as Gwen said: &quot;We didn't 
                    really know what kind of music we were gonna write because 
                    it had been so long and we kind of out grew our old style.&quot;

                    poetry, which influenced me. I really thought about it. The

                    or was arty in that way, but this time I did. I, for the first 
                    time, wrote two songs on my own: 'Simple Kind of Life' and

                    assessing my life over the last couple years--like what am 
                    I doing. There are a lot of love songs on the album, but there 
                    are others that are about questioning life. 'Six Feet Under' 
                    is all about the cycle of life for instance. There is a lot

                    that's 'Bath Water.' It started out spontaneously with Tony 
                    playing this really simple bass line with a groove to it. 
                    Gwen started singing words to it and 40 minutes later we had 
                    a song, a really fun song. It sounds like old No Doubt, but 
                    it sounds like us at the age we are now. It's one of my favorites...

                    &quot;It's more mature, organic and natural because we were 
                    more comfortable as a band. That, and the songs were essentially 
                    written with acoustic guitar and vocals, which means that 
                    if they are boiled down to their primary and bare roots, they 
                    sound great--naked, natural and great. In other words, it's
