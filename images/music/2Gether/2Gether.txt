Jerry: A real chiseled HUNK. Sings like nobody's business. The group leader. 

Q.T.: The "young one." Dewy-eyed, not totally healthy. But adorable, and sings like a mutha. 

Chad: The "shy one." Absolutely fetching, a little on the dumb side. 

Doug: Chad's older brother. Old, balding, all-around good guy. 

Mickey: The "bad boy." Picks fights, acts tough. A self-described "pimp."
