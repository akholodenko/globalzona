La Bouche - http://rollingstone.tunes.com/sections/artists/text/artistgen.asp?afl=fans&LookUpString=4350

A pop duo composed of vocalist Melanie Thornton and rapper Lane McCray,
 La Bouche got their start in Frankfurt, Germany. While both artists 
are American, the duo has managed to gather a devoted following in both
 Europe and Canada. Their 1996 debut album, Sweet Dreams, produced 
"Fallin' in Love" and "Be My Lover," two meaty, beaty, big and bouncy 
pop singles that instantly became Euro-dance hits. 
All Mixed Up, a series of remixes, appeared in 1996 and paved the way 
for 1997's Moment of Love. S.O.S. followed in 1998.
