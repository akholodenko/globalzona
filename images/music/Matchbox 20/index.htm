                  TWENTY</font> </b><br>
                  <br>
                  "Mad season by matchbox twenty," the long-awaited second Melisma/Lava/Atlantic 
                  release from matchbox twenty, stands as a great leap forward 
                  for one of today's most compelling rock n' roll groups.Following 
                  the stunning success of their explosive 1996 Lava/Atlantic debut, 
                  "YOURSELF OR SOMEONE LIKE YOU," this soul-infused collection 
                  of modern classics amply demonstrates the band's remarkably 
                  expressive range and power.From the potent and powerful pop 
                  of "Black & White People" to the turbulent "Angry" and "You 
                  Won't Be Mine," each of the new album's thirteen tracks is a 
                  showcase for the dynamic, melodic matchbox twenty sound, as 
                  well as the singular mark of triple Grammy-winner Rob Thomas's 
                  intimate yet universal songwriting. <br>
                  <br>
                  Having spent over 600 nights on the road since the release of 
                  their explosive 1996 Melisma/Lava/Atlantic debut, "YOURSELF 
                  OR SOMEONE LIKE YOU," matchbox twenty has grown into a creative 
                  musical machine firing on all cylinders.Thomas's rich vocals 
                  have ripened in both strength and maturity, as have Kyle Cook 
                  and Adam Gaynor's heartfelt harmonies and chiming twin guitar 
                  arrangements.Binding these elements together is the inventive, 
                  propulsive rhythm section of bassist Brian Yale and drummer 
                  Paul Doucette. <br>
                  <br>
                  "When we made our first record, we hadn't really been a band 
                  for very long," Thomas says."We hadn't had any really good fights, 
                  we hadn't had any really good laughs, we hadn't done much of 
                  anything together.But now, so much has happened to us that we've 
                  formed a character within ourselves.So this is really the first 
                  time we're saying, 'This is matchbox twenty making a record,' 
                  because now matchbox twenty is its own entity.This is the first 
                  one where we can really say, this is our sound." <br>
                  <br>
                  Recorded in Atlanta and Nashville during the second half of 
                  1999, "mad season by matchbox twenty" was produced by dual Grammy 
                  Award-winner Matt Serletic ("Record of the Year"/"Album of the 
                  Year"), the man behind the board for "YOURSELF OR SOMEONE LIKE 
                  YOU."Late last year, that album - a Billboard Top Five smash 
                  - earned the RIAA's prestigious Diamond Award, marking certified 
                  U.S. sales in excess of 10 million units and adding matchbox 
                  twenty's name to a very elite roster of artists who have reached 
                  this major career milestone. <br>
                  <br>
                  "It was freakish," says Thomas of the group's incredible achievement."You 
                  can't compete with it and you can't recreate it, so we were 
                  in a good position.All we had to worry about was making a great 
                  record." <br>
                  <br>
                  "mad season by matchbox twenty" highlights the continuing development 
                  of Thomas'sgifts as a writer, with songs that focus on the binding 
                  elements of our increasingly unconnected world.Where many sophomore 
                  records reflect an artist's newly isolated existence - with 
                  songs either telling of bus windows and endless highways, of 
                  the terrible traumas of fame and fortune - here Thomas spins 
                  poignant stories of love and loss, of life and how to live it. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  "Your career is just one aspect of who you are," Thomas notes."Most 
                  of the things I write about are still basic emotions. If you 
                  sell a billion records, and the only thing you can come up with 
                  to write about is selling a billion records, then you're probably 
                  a pretty shallow person.There has to be something else in your 
                  life that you can draw on other than 'I'm rich and famous.'" 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Thomas was recently honored with three Grammy Awards for "Smooth," 
                  his 1999 chart-topping collaboration with Carlos Santana.The 
                  track earned him "Song of the Year" honors; the "Record of the 
                  Year" trophy (along with Santana, producer Matt Serletic, and 
                  engineer/mixer David Thoener); and the "Best Pop Collaboration 
                  with Vocals" award, which he shared with Santana.Thomas's hat 
                  trick was the second-highest tally of the 42nd Annual Grammy 
                  Awards, following Santana himself with eight. <br>
                  <br>
                  "I just fell bass-ackwards into luck again," says Rob."Everything 
                  about 'Smooth' has been so special and so beautiful.We were 
                  taking our time making 'mad season,' so 'Smooth' became this 
                  really good bridge.We needed a break, and it kept us from the 
                  'Where Are They Now?' file." <br>
                  <br>
                  Thomas - who won in every category in which he was nominated 
                  - had previously earned a Grammy nomination for matchbox twenty's 
                  hit single, "Push," which received a 1998 nod in the "Best Rock 
                  Performance By A Duo Or Group With Vocal" category.Among his 
                  other honors, Thomas received the 1999 "Pop Songwriter of the 
                  Year" award from the performing rights organization BMI.He was 
                  recognized for penning three songs on the year's most-performed 
                  songs list, and shared the "Pop Songwriter of the Year" title 
                  with Mariah Carey, Shania Twain, and Sarah McLachlan.In addition, 
                  BMI presented three tracks from "YOURSELF OR SOMEONE LIKE YOU" 
                  - "3am," "Real World," and "Push" (previously awarded for being 
                  among 1998's most-performed songs) - with their 1999 "Pop Award."

                  <br>
                  "Every great spirit lined up the right way so that we could 
                  be afforded this success," Thomas says."And I think we've taken 
                  that success and done the right things with it.We don't take 
                  ourselves too seriously, and we haven't forgotten what it's 
                  all about, which is the music." <br>

                  Born on a military base in Germany, Rob Thomas spent much of 
                  his youth shuttling between his grandmother in South Carolina 
                  and his mom in Florida.After dropping out of both high school 
                  and his difficult home life, the 17-year-old Rob drifted around 
                  the Southeast, hitchhiking and crashing where he could.The only 
                  constant of the young man's life was music, an inspiring soundtrack 
                  which included artists ranging from Al Green and Van Morrison 
                  to Elvis Costello and R.E.M.He released the pressures of his 
                  life in his songwriting, just as he developed his gutsy vocal 
                  style fronting a number of local rock bands.Settling in the 
                  Orlando area, he found common musical ground with drummer Paul 
                  Doucette and bassist Brian Yale, and the three formed a partnership.They 
                  recruited guitarist Adam Gaynor from his job at Miami's Criteria 
                  Recording Studios and guitarist Kyle Cook from his studies at 
                  the Atlanta Institute of Music.matchbox twenty was born. <br>
                  <br>
                  As quickly as they'd come together, the band found themselves 
                  signed to Lava/Atlantic and were soon recording their debut 
                  album with producer Matt Serletic (Collective Soul, Aerosmith).With 
                  the release of "Push," the band scored a dramatic multi-format 
                  breakthrough single and a video channel favorite, pushing matchbox 
                  twenty and 1996's "YOURSELF OR SOMEONE LIKE YOU" into the spotlight.They 
                  kicked off Summer 1997 with an early set at the massive Blockbuster 
                  Rockfest at the Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, a performance 
                  which was deemed the long day's highlight.That July, the group 
                  made their network television debut, blowing the roof off Late 
                  Show with David Letterman with a knockout rendition of "Push."They 
                  returned to the Ed Sullivan Theater late that year to perform 
                  "3am", after taking the stage in September for their debut on 
                  The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. <br>
                  <br>
                  All four singles released from "YOURSELF OR SOMEONE LIKE YOU" 
                  - that is, "Push," "3am," "Real World," and "Back 2 Good" -became 
                  radio favorites, topping the airplay charts at most formats.Proving 
                  that the band's talents are visual as well as sonic, the arresting 
                  companion video clips were Heavy Rotation hits at both MTV and 
                  VH1.The accolades began piling up, as matchbox twenty won the 
                  illustrious "Best New Band" award in Rolling Stone's 1997 Reader's 
                  Poll, as well as Billboard's 1997 "Duo/Group," and the "Favorite 
                  Group:New Artist" trophy at 1997's Blockbuster Entertainment 
                  Awards.The album was also listed among the top 10 in Spin magazine's 
                  1998 "Year In Music" issue, while Thomas's charismatic frontman 
                  persona prompted People to include him in their 1998 "50 Most 
                  Beautiful People In The World" issue. <br>

                  All the while, matchbox twenty toured constantly, to ever-larger, 
                  always-sold-out houses.In early 1998, the band taped a blistering 
                  performance at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom for MTV's Live 
                  At The Ten Spot in-concert program.With America plainly captivated 
                  by the band's sweeping sound and songs, the next step was to 
                  bring their music to the rest of the world.Following a series 
                  of acclaimed dates and promo appearances in Europe, matchbox 
                  twenty embarked on their first tour of Australia.The band, which 
                  had clicked with fans Down Under on a level par with the U.S. 
                  - with the album reaching #1 on the charts - arrived in Oz to 
                  find all dates sold out, including a five-night stand in Sydney.The 
                  tour was filmed for posterity, with performances from all points 
                  gathered together to form "matchbox twenty LIVE FROM AUSTRALIA," 
                  the band's first full-length home video release.On the global 
                  front, the band accumulated an impressive list of certifications 
                  for "YOURSELF OR SOMEONE LIKE YOU": eight-times platinum in 
                  Australia, quintuple platinum in New Zealand, quadruple platinum 
                  in Canada, platinum in the Philippines, and gold in Ireland 
                  and Indonesia. <br>
                  <br>
                  "Rob's message is universal," says guitarist Adam Gaynor of 
                  the band's global popularity."What he's saying appeals to so 
                  many people." <br>

                  1999 was spent vacationing, woodshedding,and readying to record 
                  the second matchbox twenty outing.When the group convened at 
                  Atlanta's Tree Studios in August, it soon became clear just 
                  how much the band had grown since their debut. <br>
                  <br>
                  "The difference was monumental," Gaynor says."We're all really 
                  proud of the first album, but we're a much more mature band 
                  now.It was a lot more fun this time.You're so nervous the first 
                  time you make a record, but now it's just about making good 
                  music and taking it up another notch." <br>
                  <br>
                  "We've matured as people, which I think is reflected in the 
                  music," guitarist Kyle Cook points out."I think we took some 
                  chances, but not at the cost of the songs.The first record was 
                  more a straight-forward rock band record, and I think we've 
                  taken the next step." <br>
                  <br>
                  "Everyone really stepped up," says bassist Brian Yale. "The 
                  difference between matchbox twenty four years ago and now, performance-wise, 
                  is just night and day." <br>
                  <br>
                  Where "YOURSELF OR SOMEONE LIKE YOU" is marked by the passionate 
                  energy of a young band hitting the studio for the first time, 
                  "mad season by matchbox twenty"features a no-holds-barred sonic 
                  approach which incorporates new textures - such as intricate 
                  orchestrations and fierce horn sections.With the able assistance 
                  of producer Matt Serletic, the band grew comfortable in the 
                  recording studio and was able to take control of their music. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  "Matt's the sixth member of the band," Thomas enthuses, "and 
                  that makes working in the studio more interesting and fun.We 
                  can trust him to say 'Try this road' or 'Do this,' because we 
                  know in the end we're all going to decide on what's best." <br>
                  <br>
                  Though Thomas is, of course, matchbox twenty's central songwriter, 
                  the album features the first-ever composing contributions by 
                  Doucette.The drummer shares writing credit with Thomas on "Stop" 
                  - which Doucette describes as "the oddest and hardest song on 
                  the record." <br>
                  <br>
                  "mad season by matchbox twenty" captures this unique quintet 
                  at the height of their powers, remarkably unburdened by any 
                  pressure to follow the monumental success of their debut.If 
                  matchbox twenty has learned anything over the last few years, 
                  it is that making great music is ultimately what matters. <br>
                  <br>
                  "It was amazing the way it all happened for us," Rob Thomas 
                  says, "and because of that, you realize that you don't have 
                  as much control over things as you thought going in.And that 
                  gives you this freedom.You're not really holding onto the reins, 
                  you're not really flying the plane, you're not really driving 
                  the car - you're really just a passenger.The only thing you're 
                  in control of is the record -you write the song, you go into 
                  the studio, you put everything into making it - but once you 
                  shrink-wrap it and put it out, it's not up to you anymore.All 
                  you can do is hope that people like it." <br>
