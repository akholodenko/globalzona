                          his father was a tennis coach for some years, in charge 
                          of the national tennis team of Denmark also for some 
                          time, young Ulf traveled quite a lot and still speaks 
                          Danish nearly faultlessly. Growing up, Ulf became quite 
                          a scruffy youth and became involved in youth gangs in 
                          and around Gothenburg before meeting Jonas and changing 
                          his life completely, dedicating it afterwards to music 
                          and anti-violence causes. He now regrets certain facets 
                          of his past: "one of my closest friends was killed... 
                          I had to awaken and follow the help of family and friends, 
                          in order to change my ways - now, I am against violence 
                          and drug abuse" he declared in 1993. While the Berggrens 
                          have stayed in their native Gothenburg, Ulf has recently 
                          relocated to Marbella, Spain. The Berggrens grew up 
                          in a happy environment, and the family loved music and 
                          singing, and the children were encouraged to study classical 
                          music. Jenny and Linn took up the violin, but that did 
                          not last for very long. They also learned children and 
                          folk songs, some taught to them by their grandparents. 
                          Linn and Jenny went on to a school teacher education 
                          before Ace Of Base started to make it internationally.

                          <b>Tech Noir, the proto-Ace Of Base </b><br>
                          Ace Of Base started out under another name, Tech Noir, 
                          and was mainly a fast-paced high energy and Techno-oriented 
                          group whose heritage is apparent in later Ace Of Base 
                          tracks such as "Just Chaos" or "Hear Me Calling". They 
                          however changed style altogether, became Ace Of Base 
                          and invented their trademark Pop & Reggae grooves. Within 
                          a very short time, they moved from obscurity to international 
                          fame and recognition, with sales of their first album 
                          "Happy Nation" soaring at a cumulative 21 million album 
                          units sold across the Globe, their second offering "The 
                          Bridge" now at approx. 5 million units sold. On the 
                          basis of the exceptional performance of the first album, 
                          the Guinness Book of Records proclaimed Ace Of Base 
                          as the 'best-ever debut album artists'. Ace Of Base 
                          originate from the harbor city of Gothenburg, know affectionately 
                          as the Liverpool of the North, due to its industries, 
                          oil refineries and its thriving music scene akin to 
                          Liverpool. Just like in the UK for what concerns London 
                          and Liverpool, there is a distinct rivalry in Sweden 
                          between the capital city of Stockholm and the far-away 
                          Gothenburg - Ace Of Base were thus to experience a lack 
                          of interest in them, due to the lukewarm reception their 
                          material achieved in Stockholm's A&R circles. After 
                          having recorded an initial version of "Wheel Of Fortune" 
                          on a studio's down-time, the original record label they 
                          were signed to did not wish to pursue the recordings 
                          and the mixing of that track - hence, Ace Of Base decided 
                          to something atypical for a Swedish artist, namely contacting 
                          a Danish label and presenting "Wheel Of Fortune" to 
                          Mega in Copenhagen. Their reason for trying Mega was 
                          due to that label's release of the UK group The KLF, 
                          whom Ace Of Base were big fans of. The demo tape was 
                          well received and generated an immediate buzz and interest 
                          at Mega, leading to a swift buy-out of the master tapes 
                          relating to "Wheel Of Fortune" and a deal with Mega. 
                          <br>
                          <b>Ace Of Base - the formative years </b><br>
                          Jonas Berggren and Ulf Ekberg had met each other around 
                          Gothenburg, and decided to work together on a musical 
                          project. The two of them started dabbling with synths, 
                          rhythm boxes and samplers, applying their newly honed 
                          skills to Techno styles. They soon found themselves 
                          wanting vocals to complement their frenetic grooves 
                          and started looking out for suitable singers. Jonas 
                          and Ulf did however not come up with anything substantial 
                          for a time, and decided to recruit Jonas' two musically 
                          endowed sisters Jenny and Malin. Just like the rest 
                          of the Berggren family, Jenny and Malin had studied 
                          music at school and were members of the local church 
                          choir as well. They thus were drafted in as members 
                          in Ace Of Base that thus became a foursome. At first, 
                          they continued writing and recording demo Techno tracks 
                          but soon began experimenting with Reggae grooves, having 
                          been inspired by collaboration with a local Rap and 
                          Reggae outfit. This resulted in the aforementioned "Wheel 
                          Of Fortune". At that point, Ace Of Base had assembled 
                          a sizable quantity of synthesizers and associated recording 
                          hardware in the form of a rehearsal and recording facility 
                          housed in a rambling shack at the outskirts of Gothenburg, 
                          sharing the space with a car repair facility and a posse 
                          of computer nerds. Jonas and Ulf had a particular liking 
                          for vintage analog synths, used prominently in all of 
                          their subsequent recording sessions. They managed thus 
                          to forge an original sound and a style distinctly of 
                          their own, with the trademark Pop-Reggae leanings evidenced 
                          also in later recordings, such as the smash hits "All 
                          That She Wants", "The Sign", "Don't Turn Around" (a 
                          cover version of an Aswad original), a.o. At an early 
                          stage, the Swedish top producer Denniz Pop became interested 
                          in Ace Of Base - in fact, their demo tape cassette got 
                          stuck in Denniz's car player, and for some time it was 
                          the only source of recorded music available to Denniz 
                          while riding his car. He was then to produce their first 
                          international hit, "All That She Wants". <br>
                          <b>Conquering Scandinavia </b><br>
                          "Wheel Of Fortune" was released in Denmark twice, without 
                          achieving airplay or sales. Mega was however undeterred 
                          by this early setback, and decided to release it for 
                          the third time. The tide changed, and the debut single 
                          started to chart achieving a peak position at #2, only 
                          to be overtaken that same week by its follow-up, "All 
                          That She Wants", that streaked by installing itself 
                          at the #1 slot. Thus, that week, Ace Of Base got a taste 
                          of what was to come, achieving a simultaneous #1 and 
                          #2 that was to pave the way for more action in Scandinavia 
                          and the rest of the World. Within a short time, Norway 
                          was subdued while Sweden watched by the sideline. The 
                          Danes soon started considering Ace Of Base as 'adopted 
                          Danes', but before long, Sweden was also conquered and 
                          Ace Of Base and Mega started looking for an international 
                          release in earnest. <br>
                          <b>Conquering Europe </b><br>
                          In the wake of their initial two successful singles, 
                          Ace Of Base recorded their debut album "Happy Nation", 
                          that started a veritable flood of #1s, Platinum Awards, 
                          a.s.o. in Scandinavia. The rest of the World at that 
                          point decided to remain distinctly unfazed and unimpressed, 
                          dismissing Ace Of Base as being merely a local phenomenon 
                          that could not possibly work in any other area of the 
                          World. All major record companies declined offers at 
                          first, rejecting the material as being 'too poppy'. 
                          Metronome Musik, a PolyGram company based in Hamburg, 
                          however decided to reconsider the whole matter and took 
                          a chance in signing Ace Of Base for an international 
                          deal covering Europe and the Far East with an option 
                          for the USA. The single "All That She Wants" was thus 
                          released in Germany, achieved a #1 chart position and 
                          paved the way for Platinum sales of the album "Happy 
                          Nation", that also achieved the coveted #1 slot. The 
                          remainder of Europe, with sensational results to follow, 
                          heavy MTV rotation and all of the hoopla associated 
                          with stardom followed up their successful chart record 
                          in Germany. <br>
                          <b>The USA </b><br>
                          Despite their tremendous results in Europe, Ace Of Base 
                          were not seen fit for the USA for some time. Again, 
                          all major labels were of the opinion that Ace Of Base 
                          would not be subject to airplay in the USA, hence missing 
                          the most important vehicle for launching successful 
                          crossover singles. Mega kept however trying onwards, 
                          hoping to eventually be able to convince the Americans 
                          of Ace Of Base's potential and worth. A significant 
                          break-through occurred, as legendary A&R honcho and 
                          now Arista president Clive Davis got interested in Ace 
                          Of Base. It seems that he had traveled in Europe on 
                          his way to a vacation aboard a yatch sailing in the 
                          Mediterranean, and could not fail to notice the intensive 
                          MTV rotation of "All That She Wants", and its airplay 
                          on all radio stations in Europe. Thus, he called up 
                          Mega in Copenhagen to inquire as to the availability 
                          of the licensing rights for the USA and other American 
                          countries as well as Japan. Following the usually complicated 
                          negotiations needed to achieve a good deal for the USA, 
                          Mega was subsequently able to sign with Arista for the 
                          Americas and Japan. As massive imports of the European 
                          "Happy Nation" album had already started to pour into 
                          the States, it was jointly decided to record some additional 
                          tracks, to differentiate the US release from its European 
                          counterpart. The revised album took its title from one 
                          of the new tracks, "The Sign". To complicate matters 
                          further, the US album was released also in Europe, this 
                          time re-titled "Happy Nation - US Version" with yet 
                          another additional track not present on the US album 
                          "The Sign". "All That She Wants" was released as the 
                          initial single for the States, and became a huge hit 
                          for Ace Of Base, making it to #1 on the Billboard Sales 
                          Chart and promptly followed up by the album, that also 
                          achieved an incredible chart run including multiple 
                          Platinum and the prestigious #1 chart position. <br>
                          <b>The Ace Of Base team </b><br>
                          After having made it to #1 in both the single and album 
                          category in the USA and with the massive success already 
                          achieved in Europe and elsewhere, it became clear that 
                          Ace Of Base were not just pretty faces. The two leading 
                          Ace Of Base composers Jonas Berggren and Ulf Ekberg 
                          were acclaimed as innovative composers and skilled producers 
                          and arrangers, ably assisted in the studio by the aforementioned 
                          Denniz PoP, having on board also the production team 
                          T.O.E.C., PoP crony Douglas Carr, the producer duo Adebratt 
                          & Ekman and several re-mix teams, including David Morales.

                          <b>The New Wave of Swedish Pop </b><br>
                          Ace Of Base were in the wake of their success hailed 
                          as being the new big thing out of Sweden, a country 
                          that has achieved an incredible number of Pop Superstars 
                          over the years. They follow in the footsteps of earlier 
                          acts such as The Spotnicks, Blue Swede, Abba, Roxette 
                          and many more... Ace Of Base were also acclaimed for 
                          revitalizing the then somewhat stagnant Reggae genre, 
                          and were invited to celebrate Bob Marley's death anniversary 
                          memorial concert where they were to appear with a plethora 
                          of Reggae acts - this was an invitation Ace Of Base 
                          reluctantly had to decline due to other, clashing commitments. 
                          They were also the best-ranking Swedes in the USA and 
                          the only Scandinavian artist to enjoy a #1 album on 
                          the Billboard sales chart - actually, they made it three 
                          times to #1, as the album soared high on the strength 
                          of the singles released, thus going back into the Top 
                          Spot on the Billboard chart twice again after its initial 
                          feat. Their singles were subject to massive doses of 
                          airplay as well across the pond, winning the BMI million 
                          performance award twice, for "The Sign" and "All That 
                          She Wants". <br>
                          <b>Far-reaching hits </b><br>
                          While achieving sensational results in Europe and the 
                          USA, Ace Of Base created a stir in far-away territories, 
                          such as the Far East, South America, Australia, South 
                          Africa and Israel for example - in Malaysia, they were 
                          particularly successful in being awarded Octuple Platinum 
                          for the "Happy Nation - US Version" album. The European 
                          trade publication Music & Media, the compiler of the 
                          Euro Chart, announced that "All That She Wants" is the 
                          European #1 for the decade 1984-1994. No wonder that 
                          their home city of Gothenburg hailed the Ace Of Base 
                          members as Honorary Citizens, and invited the group 
                          to perform live at the 1995 World Games in Gothenburg. 
                          In France, the album went #1 for the third time, earning 
                          the prestigious award Disque de Diamant, for sales in 
                          excess of 1 million units. The musicians' magazine Keyboard 
                          USA also nominated Ace Of Base in the category 'best 
                          new synthesizer artist' while the engineer and producer 
                          magazine EQ USA ran an interview, detailing their production 
                          techniques. The massive success of Ace Of Base on the 
                          World stage and all the hoopla associated with fame 
                          and fortune left them quite unfazed. They had their 
                          share of false rumors concerning an impending group 
                          split that never materialized and queries as to Ulf's 
                          past. There were also some dramatic moments, as a deranged 
                          German female would-be fan trespassed the Berggren's 
                          home in the middle of the night, threatening Jenny, 
                          her mother and father with a huge and mean-looking machete. 
                          The Berggrens were however able to overpower the woman 
                          after a brief but bloody scruffle in Jenny's parents 
                          bedroom. Soon subdued, the woman was taken in custody 
                          by the police and ambulances came to rescue of Jenny's 
                          wounded mother. Notwithstanding these episodes, Jenny 
                          and Malin still regularly sing in the local church choir 
                          on Sundays and the whole Ace Of Base operation shuts 
                          down for a couple of weeks each Summer, as Jenny keeps 
                          her volunteer job, helping Christian children in a Swedish 
                          Summer camp. <br>
                          <b>Preparing their next album "The Bridge" </b><br>
                          At Mega, the demos needed for the preparation of the 
                          next Ace Of Base album were anxiously awaited - indeed, 
                          Jonas phoned up one day, stating that he had the bulk 
                          of his contributions ready and would turn up the next 
                          day at Mega's office to present them. He thus came, 
                          equipped with an acoustic guitar and proceeded to sing 
                          and explain the new songs live, rather than presenting 
                          the usual cassette demo. This harks back to the grand 
                          ole days of songwriters and goes to show that Ace Of 
                          Base are definitely not in a state of dependency of 
                          new-fangled synthesizer, sampler, and sequencing techniques 
                          and would certainly hold their own in an 'unplugged' 
                          situation. Ace Of Base went on to record their new material, 
                          at times using up to four studios simultaneously, with 
                          Jenny and Malin trekking back-and-forth in order to 
                          record their vocals. Their composition "Lucky Love" 
                          was premiered at the aforementioned Gothenburg World 
                          Games and broadcast all over the World by satellite. 
                          The album "The Bridge" also signaled a more prominent 
                          writer's role for Jenny and Malin, represented on the 
                          album with several own compositions. "Lucky Love" was 
                          followed up by the next singles "Beautiful Life" and 
                          "Never Gonna Say I'm Sorry" yielding more hits and pushing 
                          the album to a cumulative 5 million units at present. 
                          Ace Of Base went yet again back to promotional appearances 
                          all over the World, spending time also in South America 
                          and the Far East. In the meanwhile, both Ace Of Base 
                          albums were released in China, a first for a Scandinavian 
                          artist. They also found the time to appear at the prestigious 
                          Chilean festival at Vina del Mar, a massive television 
                          spectacular that was broadcast widely in Latin America. 
                          The hits recorded by Ace Of Base became vehicles for 
                          other artists, in a variety of languages and cover versions 
                          and popular also for the Karaoke set. Their compositions 
                          have also shown and incredible longevity, enjoying airplay 
                          even in their chart aftermath while the release of the 
                          new album additionally signified a resurgence of sales 
                          for their first. At present, with countless Gold and 
                          Platinum awards to their name, the future of Ace Of 
                          Base looks bright as both Jonas and Ulf have grown significantly 
                          as composers, contributing songs to other artists besides 
                          Ace Of Base. The stature of Ace Of Base as "best-selling 
                          Scandinavian Artist" of the Nineties was recently reiterated, 
                          as Ace Of Base achieved their fourth World Music Award 
                          in a row, while cumulative album sales were up to 26 
                          million units. Ace Of Base presented the Jenny Berggren 
                          composition "Ravine", with Jenny herself handling the 
                          lead vocal duties. They also became finally accepted 
                          in their home country of Sweden, as they were specifically 
                          invited by the Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden to 
                          perform at her birthday, celebrated on July 14th, 1997. 
                          Ace Of Base presented a 40-minute live concert for the 
                          Crown Princess and an audience of about 6,000 people 
                          on the summer resort island of Oland, Sweden. <br>
                          <b>A fan network on the World Wide Web </b><br>
                          Ace Of Base have a remarkable fan following, despite 
                          their relatively low profile in the Media since the 
                          release of "The Bridge". More than 60 fan home pages 
                          are present on the 'net in the USA, with several chat 
                          rooms for fan interaction. There are also AOB sites 
                          in Europe, South America, Canada and Japan. <br>
                          <b>"Flowers" - third album </b><br>
                          More than two years in the making, the third Ace Of 
                          Base album is now in its final completion phase and 
                          will show new facets of their talents. Jenny has grown 
                          significantly as a vocalist and is this time handling 
                          most of the lead vocals, with sister Linn taking a more 
                          supportive role within the band at present. Jonas and 
                          Ulf have also matured as composers and producers, as 
                          can easily be evidenced by their album contributions. 
                          The album harks back to quintessential Ace Of Base sounds 
                          in some cases but also pursues new avenues in Pop, like 
                          the retro-oriented track "Donnie" at a furious 70s pace, 
                          for example. A team of external producers was brought 
                          in to work with Jonas and Ulf on the tracks slated for 
                          the album, including luminaries such as Charles Fisher 
                          (The Savage Garden) and Stephen Hague (Pet Shop Boys) 
                          as well as resident Stockholm producer Douglas Carr, 
                          have all significantly contributed to the creation of 
                          "Flowers". Mixes for Fisher's tracks were done by either 
                          of Chris Lord-Alge in Los Angeles or David Leonard in 
                          Nashville. Two Danish producer teams have also worked 
                          on tracks for the third album, namely Johnny Jam & Delgado 
                          (Aqua) and Cutfather & Joe (many UK and US remixes). 
                          In Sweden, Ace Of Base also worked with the trusted 
                          team of Adebratt & Ekman and with producers Douglas 
                          Carr, John Amatiello and Stonestream. The end result 
                          sounds like a "grand tour of Pop music" of the past 
                          decades, with elements ranging from influences from 
                          the 50s to the 70s ("Cecilia", "Donnie"), to the latest 
                          electronica of "Tokyo Girl". As on their first album, 
                          Ace Of Base are including a cover version on their present 
                          album - this time the song covered is "Cruel Summer", 
                          a hit for Bananarama in the early 80s, and is available 
                          in two markedly different versions on the album. The 
                          new album also shows a change of direction. Many tracks 
                          widely use acoustic instruments, such as guitars and 
                          string sections. For the ultimate authenticity, some 
                          sessions were conducted at the famous Polar Studios 
                          in Stockholm where Abba used to record. While the bulk 
                          of the album songs were written by Jonas Berggren, Jenny 
                          contributed the beautiful "He Decides" while Ulf co-composed 
                          with John Ballard the tracks "I Pray" and "Don't Go 
                          Away". <br>
