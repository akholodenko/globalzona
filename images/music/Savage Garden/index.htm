                        Savage Garden defies ease of definition in a modern-day 
                        music world where acts are packaged into one of a handful 
                        of neatly - and yet often limiting - niches. Instead, 
                        the duo of singer/songwriter Darren Hayes and tunesmith/ 
                        instrumentalist Daniel Jones harkens a day when intelligent 
                        lyrics, gloriously accessible melodies and crafty production 
                        illustrate music for the masses in their most illuminated 
                        form. Through worldwide sales of 11 million of its 1997 
                        self-titled debut, Savage Garden has conjured a definition 
                        of pop music with the most positive connotations, thanks 
                        to their worldwide hit singles, "I Want You," "To The 
                        Moon And Back," and "Truly Madly Deeply." With the release 
                        of their emotionally-charged second studio album on Columbia 
                        Records, the 12 -track, "AFFIRMATION," Hayes and Jones 
                        are embarking on a brave new journey, more intimate than 
                        ever and yet with a reach that's universal via its prevailing 
                        themes of love and love lost, <img src="IKnewILovedYou.jpg" width="160" height="120" align="right">despair, 
                        and the hope and faith that come from learning to channel 
                        emotions into lessons learned. The album, which was recorded 
                        in San Francisco and New York, was produced by the Grammy-winning, 
                        Walter Afanasieff (Ricky Martin, Mariah Carey, Celine 
                        Dion, Michael Bolton), with Hayes and Jones co-producing 
                        and writing all songs. "Musically, lyrically, and performance-wise, 
                        we wanted this album to grow out of something natural," 
                        says Hayes. "It's almost beautifully sad, in a kind of 
                        bittersweet way." Hayes practically forced himself into 
                        emotional upheaval by transplanting from his home in Australia 
                        and moving to Manhattan for a year in 1998, to feed off 
                        of the city's ironic mix of intoxicating adventure countered 
                        by its sometimes consuming loneliness. <br>
                        "I placed myself in very adverse conditions because I 
                        was intent on making a record that could be a soundtrack 
                        not just to my life, but to everybody's lives," Hayes 
                        says. "I experienced very real things, where I had to 
                        make new friends, to miss my family, <img src="savage_garden_cd_cover_1.gif" width="100" height="99" align="left">to 
                        carry six bags of groceries from the corner market to 
                        my apartment without a car or a trolley - just the normal 
                        day-to-day struggle of being in a new place." <br>
                        And while there are themes of loss and emptiness, Hayes 
                        says that lyrically, the project consistently focuses 
                        on looking past such despair. "This is hopeful sadness. 
                        I don't wallow in self-pity. Elation and pain are experiences 
                        that make you realize you're alive. Thank God you feel 
                        them; otherwise you'd be numb. That would be the worst 
                        thing," he says. <br>
                        Musically, "the horizons really opened up for us in terms 
                        of sound," says Jones of Wallyworld Studios, the cutting 
                        edge San Francisco-based complex owned by Afanasieff, 
                        where much of the project was tracked. "The expertise 
                        of his people and the quality of the equipment allowed 
                        us to experiment with sounds and techniques that weren't 
                        accessible to us the first time around. We wanted to infuse 
                        some elements of techno and keyboard sounds with guitars 
                        and still get the emotion through with the vocal on top. 
                        We were able to play around with a lot of samples and 
                        do some obscure editing with a lot of loops." <br>
                        "It was important to make sure every song sounded different, 
                        so one of the biggest things we achieved was bigger, better 
                        production with a whole new bag of editing and instrumental 
                        tricks," Jones says. <br>
                        Among the tracks on the album is first single "I Knew 
                        I Loved You," a sweet, scintillating ballad. The song 
                        glitters with devotion and the joy of true love: "I think 
                        I've found my best friend/I know that it might sound more 
                        than a little crazy but I believe/I knew I loved you before 
                        I met you/I think I dreamed you into life." <br>
                        "It's a very simple love song," Hayes notes. "Nothing 
                        else on the record is as pure as that one, and I think 
                        it was essential for this album." <br>
                        "There was a sense of innocence that was missing between 
                        the first album and this one," Jones adds. "We needed 
                        to find that place we started from and be able to identify 
                        again with 'Truly Madly Deeply.' I think it turned out 
                        beautifully." <br>
                        Other highlights include the hitworthy title track, a 
                        free-wheeling romp of nearly two dozen one-line life lessons, 
                        learned through both adversity and good fortune; "Two 
                        Beds & A Coffee Machine," a startling and tragic piano-based 
                        take on spousal abuse; "The Animal Song," the percussion-soaked 
                        anthemic roust also found on the soundtrack to the recent 
                        Diane Keaton/Juliette Lewis film 'The Other Sister'; and 
                        "I Don't Know You Anymore," which tells of visiting a 
                        loved one from the past and recognizing that they have 
                        moved forward with their life ("The picture frames have 
                        changed/So has your name"). <br>
                        In addition to a more personal lyrical palette and the 
                        increasingly textured instrumental presentation, "AFFIRMATION" 
                        also brings on a clarification of the roles that most 
                        comfortably fit the pair of longtime collaborators and 
                        friends - who wrote their first album holed up in a one-bedroom 
                        apartment in a rural section of Australia, armed only 
                        with complementary talents and few ideas of the complexities 
                        that fame would soon bring them. <br>
                        "I've always wanted to be more of the Dave Stewart than 
                        the Annie Lennox of the band," Jones explains. "I'm more 
                        comfortable with the musician side, so I will be moving 
                        into that arena a lot more - like band rehearsals, remixes, 
                        things with the music. I've never been comfortable with 
                        being any kind of celebrity, so we decided that Darren 
                        will act as more of the spokesman of the band." <br>
                        "At first, we felt like we were supposed to homogenize 
                        ourselves like Frick and Frack, this team that always 
                        did everything together," Hayes adds. "But it's true, 
                        I enjoy being the public face of this band, where Daniel 
                        is more interested in designing sounds and producing. 
                        We sat down and agreed, I'm good at this, you're great 
                        at that. We'll continue to write music and come together 
                        on stage and make videos, but the rest of it, we'll play 
                        it the way we know it and prefer it." <br>
                        It's this inner growth that so ably allows SAVAGE GARDEN 
                        to demonstrate tangible steps forward on "AFFIRMATION," 
                        an album whose tight, well-executed songs demonstrate 
                        command of a destiny replete with many a shining moment 
                        to come. <br>
                        "I think there's a tendency for sophomore albums to topically 
                        come out as a reaction to success or fame, but I think 
                        that's boring," Hayes says. "What people do relate to 
                        is what it's like to have their hearts broken, to fall 
                        in love, or to have that occasional bad day. Those are 
                        things that continue to affect all of us every day of 
                        every year." <br>
