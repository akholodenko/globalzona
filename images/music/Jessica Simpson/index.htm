          <table width="454" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
            <tr> 
              <td>
                <div align="justify"><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She 
                  is bright, beautiful and blessed. She possesses a voice that 
                  is capable of expressing the heartache of first love and the 
                  wondrous possibilities of an everlasting tomorrow. Her live 
                  shows have been marked by a youthful exuberance coupled with 
                  a seasoned professionalism that belies her 19 years. In an era 
                  of pre-fabricated wind-up divas, she is refreshingly honest, 
                  remarkably focused and positive, and true to her self, her beliefs 
                  and her heart. <br>
                  She is Jessica Simpson and Sweet Kisses, her Columbia Records 
                  debut, is an appealing and satisfying blend of pop, R&B and 
                  gospel-infused music that heralds the emergence of a bright 
                  new star. "<br>
                  Recording Sweet Kisses is the culmination of a dream," Jessica 
                  offers, "not only because people will get the opportunity to 
                  hear my music but also because I'm hoping that my fans will 
                  also see that you can be a good person and lead a good life 
                  and still have fun!" <br>
                  The first single is "I Wanna Love You Forever," a soaring, passionate 
                  ballad written and produced by Sam Watters (of Color me Badd) 
                  and Louis Biancanella (Mariah Carey)."The song is so beautiful," 
                  exclaims Jessica. "It's so romantic and that's the kind of singer 
                  I am. I love passion and I love love because I am such a sucker 
                  for that sort of thing. It's a song about having a love for 
                  someone for the rest of your life. That can apply to family, 
                  a guy, a friend, whomever. That universal emotion really appeals 
                  to me." <br>
                  <img src="Boxtalk.jpg" width="160" height="120" align="left">Another 
                  track that touches Jessica's heart is "Where You Are," which 
                  pairs Jessica up with 98 Degree's Nick Lachey. "I toured with 
                  98 Degrees this past spring. It was my first tour ever and it 
                  was just an incredible experience! Watching 98 Degrees perform 
                  every night, I had this idea that I should record something 
                  with Nick and when this song came along it was perfect!" <br>
                  "Where You Are," another emotional ballad, also speaks to universal 
                  feelings. "It's a song, quite honestly, about death but it examines 
                  it from a positive, spiritual way," Jessica explains. "I think 
                  anyone who's gone through the sadness of that sort of loss will 
                  be able to draw peace and comfort from this song." <br>
                  Jessica co-wrote "Heart Of Innocence," which she dedicates to 
                  her future husband, no matter who he might be. "I believe in 
                  one true love," Jessica declares, "so I really wanted this song 
                  not to be cheesy or preachy but rather just truthful, because 
                  I do believe in abstinence and commitment. The lyrics come straight 
                  from a dream I had and are so personal and real to me, because 
                  I know that innocence can be sexy and that you can be confident 
                  and at ease with your sexuality and your womanliness without 
                  having sex. I am." <br>
                  It's not just on powerful ballads that Jessica shines: she also 
                  rocks the house on tracks like "Woman In Me," which features 
                  labelmates Destiny's Child. "'Woman In Me' is a very inspirational 
                  song because it address issues of self-esteem and self-worth. 
                  It's so important to me that people love themselves for who 
                  they are and that they appreciate all of the beauty that's in 
                  their souls." <br>
                  It's the desire to make her music more than just cute radio 
                  fodder that drives Jessica, who has viewed singing and performing 
                  as her life's work since she was a young child growing up in 
                  Texas. <br>
                  A native of Dallas, Jessica first developed her singing skills 
                  in the local Baptist church where her father, a psychologist, 
                  also served as a youth minister. When Jessica was 12 she auditioned 
                  for the Mickey Mouse Club. Jessica's talents and presence took 
                  her all the way to the finals, where she admittedly freaked 
                  out during her last audition. "I froze, she laughs, "but the 
                  experience made me even stronger and more convinced that I was 
                  on the right path" <br>
                  The following year while attending church camp, Jessica, who 
                  had always loved to sing along with the radio, delivered an 
                  a cappella version of "Amazing Grace" for one of the camp's 
                  guest speakers, who was in the process of launching a gospel 
                  music label. Jessica signed to the label and worked on an album 
                  for three years during which time the small label folded. The 
                  setback didn't deter Jessica one bit and she took the material 
                  she had worked on and began to hit the Christian Youth Conference 
                  circuit, singing her inspirational and upbeat odes to audiences 
                  of upwards of 20, 000. With her grandmother paying to press 
                  and release her ill-fated record, Jessica and her father hit 
                  the road, with her father speaking and Jessica singing to delighted 
                  crowds throughout the country. After the show Jessica's homemade 
                  album would be sold and very quickly this tiny project took 
                  on a life of its own. News of the teenage Texan with the grown-up 
                  voice soon began to filter out of the religious world and into 
                  the pop music realm and it was only a matter of time before 
                  the major labels expressed interest. <br>
                  <img src="IWannaLoveYouForever.jpg" width="160" height="120" align="right">"I 
                  was determined that I be able to stay who I am if I signed to 
                  a non-Christian music label," Jessica says firmly, "and when 
                  I met with Tommy Mottola (Chairman and CEO, Sony Music Entertainment) 
                  he was genuinely impressed with my beliefs and was completely 
                  supportive. I remember singing for him and he told me, "you 
                  are going to change the world with the power of your heart and 
                  your music. When he said that, I knew that I had a home with 
                  Sony." <br>
                  Already an established star in the Christian music world, where 
                  she often appeared on bills with Kirk Franklin, God's Property 
                  and Ce Ce Winans, Jessica's next challenge came in taking her 
                  faith and spectacular voice to a wider audience. <br>
                  "I knew that in pop music I had more of a chance to reach more 
                  people," Jessica offers, "I knew that somehow, it was all in 
                  God's plan for me to make the music I make and to touch the 
                  people." <br>
                  As one might expect from an artist so focused, this is one young 
                  woman who refuses to be content with the flash and burn of teen 
                  sensation status. "I feel like I can bring a freshness, no matter 
                  what age the person listening to my music is. And I think that 
                  freshness and that innocence is something that is missing from 
                  a lot of female singers. I'm certainly not denying that I'm 
                  young, but I'm not fluff." <br>
                  Filled with undeniable spirit and bolstered by a soaring sumptuous 
                  voice that defies comparisons, Jessica Simpson is a young woman 
                  who can not be denied. "I know it sounds crazy, but I just love 
                  this record so much! And the thing that I'm most proud of is 
                  that when you listen to it, it's like you're on an emotional 
                  ride. My music takes you somewhere and, at the end of the day, 
                  that's what's so awesome about making music. That it has power 
                  and it's something I'm so proud to share."<br>
