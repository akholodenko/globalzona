Synopsis
--------
A story of New York City next-door neighbors who are worlds apart. In 
New York's Lower East Side, conservative retired security guard Walt 
Koontz (De Niro) tries to help a neighbor in trouble and ends up 
suffering a stroke which leaves him with partial paralysis. Walt 
refuses to leave his apartment to get therapy, instead undergoing an 
in-home regimen -- one part of which involves singing lessons from his 
upstairs neighbor, a streetwise drag queen by the name of Rusty 
(Hoffman). Their sessions together are eventful, and eye-opening on 
both sides.
