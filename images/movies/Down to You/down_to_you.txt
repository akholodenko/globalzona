Synopsis
--------
Al (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and Imogen (Julia Stiles) fall for each other 
fast and hard, but when their mischievous friends start interfering, 
Al gets cold feet and it looks like he may lose not only the struggle 
between true love and temptation but Imogen herself. Set against the 
chaos of New York City college life, this romantic comedy is about 
deciding what you want, versus what every one else thinks you should 
want.
