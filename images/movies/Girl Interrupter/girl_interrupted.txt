Synopsis 
Based on the novel that recounts her true story, Susanna Kaysen (Ryder)
 is a young woman assigned to a short stay at a noted psychiatric 
institution during the 1960's after being questionably diagnosed with 
borderline personality disorder. There she is drawn to Lisa (Jolie), a 
thrill-seeking mental patient also living on the ward. As her short 
stay turns into a yearlong ordeal, Susanna's perception of reality 
versus delusion, and confinement versus freedom are blurred; she 
becomes increasingly involved with the microcosm of the mental hospital
and begins to lose touch with the outside world.
