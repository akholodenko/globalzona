Synopsis
--------
Already being called an "instant classic" by those lucky enough to have
seen a sneak preview, P. T. Anderson's Magnolia is one of the most 
anticipated movies of the holiday season. After his tour de force 
Boogie Nights it's not difficult to imagine why. But maybe it has 
something to do with the Robert Altman-esque type trailer that recently
hit theaters or the vague descriptions that have been leaked to the 
masses. But from what we know we think it goes something like this: 
the movie takes place in one day in the San Fernando Valley and it's 
an ensemble piece which loosely revolves around the core relationships 
of an ailing father (Jason Robards), his young wife (Julianne Moore), 
and his "lost" son (Tom Cruise). The cast also includes some of P. T.'s
old favorites like John C. Reilly and Philip Seymour Hoffman.
