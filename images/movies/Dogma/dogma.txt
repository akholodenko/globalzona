Synopsis 
When two fallen angels (Damon and Affleck) attempt to re-enter Heaven 
by way of a religious loophole, God calls upon a woman named Bethany 
(Linda Fiorentino) to stop them. Swept up in a cross-country journey, 
Bethany is aided by a series of celestial companions, including a muse 
turned stripper (Salma Hayek), a messenger from God (Alan Rickman), 
and a rather annoyed thirteenth apostle (Chris Rock).
