Android Andrew (Williams) discovers his human side when he's bought by 
the Martin family to help out around the house. In a story that spans 
two centuries, Andrew learns about life, love, and the dangers of rust 
with the help of the Martins and their precocious daughter (Hallie 
Eisenberg, that cute Pepsi girl). Bicentennial Man is the second 
collaboration between Williams and director Chris Columbus, who 
previously teamed up for the wildly successful Mrs. Doubtfire. The 
pair hopes that Williams in a full-body robot suit will bring the same 
box office success as Williams in a wig and heels.
