Synopsis 
--------
Television writer Alan Ball's first produced screenplay introduces us 
to the chaotic world found on the tree-lined street of Robin Hood 
Trail, Anytown, U.S.A. Provoked by forbidden passions, Lester Burnham 
(Kevin Spacey) decides to make a few changes in his rut of a life 
changes that are less midlife crisis than adolescence reborn. The 
freer he gets, the happier he gets, which is even more maddening to 
his wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening), and daughter Jane (Thora Birch)--
especially when he turns his lustful gaze toward Jane's friend, the 
sultry Angela (Mena Suvari). Carolyn responds by focusing her 
attention on real estate colleague Buddy Kane (Peter Gallagher).


Compounding the chaos on Robin Hood Trail is the arrival next door of 
an equally turbulent family: strict Marine Col. Fitts (Chris Cooper), 
his vacant wife, Barbara (Allison Janney), and his distant son, Ricky 
(Wes Bentley), who soon develops a fascination with Jane.
