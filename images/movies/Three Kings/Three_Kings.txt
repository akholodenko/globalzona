Synopsis 
--------
When the Gulf War ends, American soldiers Archie Gates (Clooney), 
Troy Barlow (Wahlberg) and Chief Elgin (Cube) decide to stay in Iraq 
to search for a cache of gold Saddam Husein was said to have stolen 
from Kuwait. Relying on a map that marks the location of the desert 
bunker where the gold supposedly is, the three men set out to find it 
and get the reward they feel they deserve. The soldiers let nothing 
stand in their way of their new capitalistic mission, fighting off any 
resistance they encounter.
