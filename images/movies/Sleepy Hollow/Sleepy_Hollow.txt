Synopsis
--------
Based on Washington Irving's classic short story The Legend of Sleepy 
Hollow, Tim Burton's take on the Headless Horseman casts Ichabod Crane
 (Johnny Depp) not as a prissy schoolteacher, but as a rational though 
unorthodox investigator from New York City who travels north to 
investigate a series of murders. The 18th-century New England village 
of Sleepy Hollow finds itself terrorized by a serial killer who removes
 his victims' heads and -- apparently -- spirits them away. In the face
 of both the town's superstitions and the daunting legend of the 
Hessian Horseman, Crane struggles to unravel the tangled mystery, 
aided in his efforts by local beauty Katrina Van Tassel (Christina 
Ricci).
