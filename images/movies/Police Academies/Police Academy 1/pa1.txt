New rules enforced by the Lady Mayoress mean that sex, weight, height 
and intelligence need no longer be a factor for joining the Police 
Force. This opens the floodgates for all and sundry to enter the Police
 Academy, much to the chagrin of the instructors. Not everyone is there
 through choice, though. Social misfit Mahoney has been forced to sign 
up as the only alternative to a jail sentence and it doesn't take long 
before he falls foul of the boorish Lieutenant Harris. But before long,
 Mahoney realises that he is enjoying being a police cadet and decides 
he wants to stay... while Harris decides he wants Mahoney out.
