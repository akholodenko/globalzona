Synopsis 
--------
A remake of the Buster Keaton film Seven Chances, The Bachelor tells 
the story of Jimmie Shannon (O'Donnell), a confirmed bachelor who 
suddenly stands to inherit $100 million, provided he is married before 
his next birthday, which unfortunately happens to be in twenty-four 
hours. His ex-girlfriend (Shields), along with at least a thousand 
other women dressed in white, answer his ad in the newspaper asking 
to meet him at the wedding chapel, and general mayhem ensues.
