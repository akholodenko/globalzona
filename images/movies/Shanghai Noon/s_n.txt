The Wild West meets the Far East in a battle for honor, royalty and a trunk full of gold when acrobatic Imperial Guard Chong Wang comes to America to rescue a beautiful kidnapped Chinese princess. With the help of a partner he doesn't trust, a wife he doesn't want, a horse he cannot ride and martial arts moves that no one can believe, Chan finds himself facing the meanest gunslingers in the West.
