Synopsis 

In this companion to the 1995 Friday, Craig Jones' (Ice Cube) life in 
his South Central L.A. hood is stirred up when the neighborhood bully 
(Lister Jr.) he helped send to jail two years earlier gets out and is 
looking to get even. Under orders from his father (Witherspoon), Craig 
is sent to live with his uncle and cousin in the posh suburbs of 
Rancho Cucamonga. But Craig can't hide, even in the suburbs and must 
once again defend his family and honor on his new turf.
