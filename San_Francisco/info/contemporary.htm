                                    <b><i>Francisco</i></b> is a collection of

                                    history, and they often are associated with 
                                    a particular ethnic or social group. </font>

                                    have acquired its present name from the term 
                                    nabob, a word of Hindu derivation meaning

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the late 19th century, 
                                    many wealthy families built their mansions 
                                    near the summit of this hill. Among them were 
                                    railroad magnates Leland Stanford, Mark Hopkins, 
                                    and Collis Huntington, each recalled today 
                                    by a hotel bearing his name that stands where 
                                    his mansion once stood. A rare surviving example 
                                    of the opulence of this age is the Pacific 
                                    Union Club, a chocolate-brown sandstone mansion 
                                    built as the residence of mining pioneer and 
                                    banker James Flood. A distinguished neighbor 
                                    and colleague of these men was Charles Crocker, 
                                    whose family donated the land on which his 
                                    mansion stood to the Episcopal church as the 
                                    site of Grace Cathedral, a majestic Gothic 
                                    structure whose stained glass rose window 
                                    looks out over Huntington Park. Other notable 
                                    religious buildings in the city are St. Mary&#39;s 
                                    Cathedral, a stark modern structure designed 
                                    by Pietro Belluschi and Pier Luigi Nervi; 
                                    Temple Emanu-El, a domed synagogue showing 
                                    Moorish architectural influence; and the Cathedral 
                                    of the Holy Virgin, whose design reflects 
                                    the congregation&#39;s Russian Orthodox heritage.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nob Hill&#39;s development 
                                    was made possible by the introduction in 1873 
                                    of the cable car. Invented by Andrew Hallidie, 
                                    this mode of transportation was designed to 
                                    climb and descend the steep hills of <b><i>San</i></b> 
                                    <b><i>Francisco</i></b>. Looking like a trolley, 
                                    the cable car is moved by a continuous motorized 
                                    cable that is sunk into the street. When the 
                                    car&#39;s motorman yanks a long lever, a mechanism 
                                    beneath the car grips the cable and the car 
                                    is pulled forward. Another lever lets the 
                                    car stop in place. While cable cars are one 
                                    of <b><i>San</i></b> <b><i>Francisco</i></b>&#39;s 
                                    prime tourist attractions, they also are used 
                                    by residents for everyday transportation. 
                                    The system was completely overhauled in 1982&#45;84.

                                    Russian Hill was probably named for the burial 
                                    place on its summit that served the city&#39;s 
                                    Russian colony, including sailors who came 
                                    to hunt seals and sea otters. Telegraph Hill 
                                    was named for the Morse code signal station 
                                    erected on its summit in 1853. On the site 
                                    is the landmark Coit Tower, which provides 
                                    visitors with splendid bay and city views. 
                                    The cylindrical structure was built in 1933 
                                    with funds provided by the eccentric Lillie 
                                    Hitchcock Coit. A fire-fighting buff, she 
                                    had the tower erected to memorialize the city&#39;s 
                                    volunteer firemen. </font> <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ACE4FF"><br>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the 1960s <b><i>San</i></b> 
                                    <b><i>Francisco</i></b> has energetically 
                                    been redeveloping its downtown area. Entire 
                                    sections were razed to make room for new office 
                                    towers, theaters, and residential enclaves. 
                                    In what some residents disparage as &#34;Manhattanization,&#34; 
                                    the city&#39;s profile has been dramatically 
                                    altered by the skyscrapers and hotel towers 
                                    sprouting in the commercial and financial 
                                    districts. The 1,500-room convention hotel 
                                    that opened on the day of the 1989 earthquake 
                                    has, for example, been dubbed the &#34;Jukebox 
                                    Marriott&#34; for the tasteless design of 
                                    its silvery glass towers. </font> <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ACE4FF"><br>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modern symbol of the 
                                    city is the Transamerica Pyramid (1972), the 
                                    spectacular work of William Pereira. John 
                                    Portman&#39;s Hyatt Regency Hotel (1973), 
                                    with its innovative 20-story atrium, is part 
                                    of the Embarcadero Center complex (1971&#45;81) 
                                    that brought new vigor to a deteriorating 
                                    downtown. Its four massive slabs rise near 
                                    the foot of California Street, one of the 
                                    city&#39;s main thoroughfares. Embarcadero 
                                    Two is the headquarters of Levi Strauss, maker 
                                    of the jeans that are <b><i>San</i></b> <b><i>Francisco</i></b>&#39;s 
                                    most famous product. </font> <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ACE4FF"><br>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even more dramatic perhaps 
                                    is the redevelopment of the blocks located 
                                    South of Market Street, known as SOMA. An 
                                    area that as late as the 1970s consisted almost 
                                    entirely of run-down industrial buildings 
                                    and dilapidated housing, SOMA now has refurbished 
                                    office buildings, new and rehabilitated homes, 
                                    and chic boutiques and restaurants. The contemporary-style 
                                    Moscone Center (1981) is a large convention 
                                    space with room for major trade shows and 
                                    political gatherings. The enormous Yerba Buena 
                                    Gardens complex nearby is a recreational and 
                                    shopping development. </font> <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#ACE4FF"><br>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typical of the urban change 
                                    is the transformation of the area known as 
                                    South Park. First settled as a fashionable 
                                    residential enclave in the mid-19th century, 
                                    it deteriorated when the gentry began building 
                                    their homes on Nob Hill. Light industry established 
                                    factories there in the late 19th and early 
                                    20th centuries. When the Bay Bridge to Oakland 
                                    was built, the approaches cut off South Park 
                                    from the city to the north. In its isolation 
                                    it became a slum, but with redevelopment South 
                                    Park was rediscovered as a home for small 
                                    businesses, restaurants, and residences. </font>

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the northern waterfront 
                                    Fisherman&#39;s Wharf, at the end of one of 
                                    the cable car lines, became a tourist attraction 
                                    in the 1960s with its &#34;walkaway&#34; seafood 
                                    treats, floating maritime museum, and street 
                                    entertainers. The most popular boat tour from 
                                    the wharf goes to Alcatraz Island, the former 
                                    federal prison. Architectural souvenirs of 
                                    the era of cargo ships have been converted 
                                    into charming walk-through complexes of atmospheric 
                                    restaurants, smart shops, and galleries. Among 
                                    these are Ghirardelli Square, once a chocolate 
                                    factory; the Cannery, built in 1894 for Del 
                                    Monte&#39;s fruit and vegetable operations; 
                                    Pier 39, reconstructed with a New England 
                                    look, using timbers from old ships; and the 
                                    Anchorage, which has a miniamphitheater. Nearby 
                                    along the bay is the Marina District&#45;&#45;known 
                                    as Harbor View when its natural amphitheater 
                                    was the scene of the 1915 Panama-Pacific International 
                                    Exposition and as the Marina-Vanderbilt Tract 
                                    (for the primary owner, Virginia Vanderbilt) 
                                    when the conversion into a chic residential 
                                    area began.</font></font></div>
